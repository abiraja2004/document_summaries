The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin Laden's activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such informant, who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden, transporting weapons and explosives, helping to buy land for his training camps and assisting in running his finances\n",
      "While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges are an indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve the embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago\n",

While the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil is viewed by Washington officials and industry executives as ancient history, Exxon and Mobil have become the dominant rivals in some retailing and refining markets, and in the production of lubricants and petrochemicals\n",
      "Leuffer said he believed divestitures necessary in this case ``could be so large that they are deal-breakers.'' Other analysts and lawyers, while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal, said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum of constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials\n",

      "Exxon and Mobil have significant concentrations of retailing and marketing concerns in the Northeast, the Southwest and the West Coast, where they also have big refining operations\n",
      "Because the two companies are involved in everything from exploration and shipping to refining and retailing, the meaning of the deal for consumers will take months for the regulators to sort out\n",
      "The regulators examining such a transaction would dissect each business, determine whether its market is global, national or more local, and determine whether the combined entity has too high a concentration of the business in those areas\n",
      "Experts agreed that the regulators are most likely to permit Exxon and Mobil to keep their exploratory and oil production businesses because those areas are already highly competitive and a merger would not result in higher prices\n",

      "They said the transaction would probably be an exchange of Mobil shares for Exxon shares\n",
      "Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about $70 billion\n",
      "The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, to find new reserves of oil and natural gas and to keep big projects profitable at a time of a deep decline in crude oil prices\n",

      "But if Exxon and Mobil agree to become one, antitrust regulators are likely to be cautious about putting back together much of what they long ago broke apart\n",
      "Even so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from combining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would do to raise them\n",
      "``The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the consumer,'' said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates\n",
      "If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could prove heaviest for energy industry employees\n",
      "Analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would be likely to lose their jobs\n",

      "Now they seem especially vulnerable as demand weakens in much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing further on already depressed prices\n",
      "``They're pitiful, helpless giants,'' said Ronald Chernow, the author of ``Titan,'' a biography of John D\n",
      "Rockefeller, Standard Oil's founder\n",
      "As such, these giants are compelled to continue cutting costs and spreading the risks of their huge, expensive international projects that are needed to develop oil reserves needed for the next century\n",
      "Mobil, with $58.4 billion in sales last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything\n",
      "But in competing for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, Mobil was unable to match Shell's offer to build a pipeline for $1 billion or more\n",
      "Oil companies have decided that they cannot count on a rebound in oil prices to revive their fortunes any time soon\n",
      "Earlier this month, the Energy Department predicted that the collapse of Asian demand would continue to depress oil prices for nearly a decade, and by as much as $5.50 a barrel in the year 2000\n",
      "And Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put off until March any decision on extending their oil production cutbacks to prop up prices\n",
      "Moreover, improving technology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions to development have added to the already huge supply of oil that is on hand now\n",
      "In response, many energy companies have already begun a new wave of cutbacks in their staffs and operations\n",
      "To further reduce costs, companies like Mobil are forming partnerships that stop short of full mergers\n",
      "Two years ago, Mobil agreed to combine its European refining and marketing operations with British Petroleum's, resulting in annual savings of about $500 million\n",
      "Shell and Texaco then formed a refining partnership in the United States\n",
      "In the face of these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, an energy analysts with the James A\n",
      "Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston, ``if you're an Exxon, how do you compete?'' Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than before oil prices collapsed in the 1980s\n",
      "Thousands of convenience stores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies, and foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies through acquired companies like Citgo\n",
      "Under Noto, Mobil has been hunting for ways of becoming large and lean enough to survive\n",
      "He took the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and has considered buying up smaller companies\n",
      "And he has made it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block a deal\n",
      "In the European agreement with British Petroleum, Mobil's red flying horses have come down from the fronts of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos have gone up\n",
      "As major oil companies team up, said John Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette, ``If the price is right, egos will not get in the way.'' In the past, Mobil reportedly had further talks with British Petroleum about other combinations, as well as talks with Amoco about forming an American refining venture\n",
      "The company was also interested in Conoco Inc\n",
      "when DuPont Co\n",
      "began looking to divest itself of that oil and gas business\n",
      "But no deals were reached\n",
      "More recently, there was speculation on Wall Street that Mobil had been talking with Chevron Corp\n",
      "British Petroleum purchase of Amoco put more pressure on Noto to seek a deal, Hervey said\n",
      "``I don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum had not pulled the trigger,'' he said\n",
      "The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly since the August announcement towards an expected $2 billion in annual savings, has put even companies as large as Exxon on the spot\n",
      "There, Raymond has so far concentrated more on making his operations more efficient than on finding allies\n",
      "Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater than Exxon's, some analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb a company of Mobil's size\n",
      "Only the largest oil companies can afford to take advantage of today's best opportunities\n",
      "Finding new fields in the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of Mexico can require platforms costing $1 billion or more\n",
      "Producing oil in the states of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and money than many investors anticipated\n",
      "In September, Noto was among the American executives invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington to greatly step up investments in his country, too\n",
      "Noto spent from 1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, building up Mobil operations including a huge refinery\n",
      "But any new partnerships with the Saudis might require both Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital\n",
      "Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York\n",
      "Even after the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, they remained for several years in the same building in Manhattan\n",
      "Chernow, the Rockefeller biographer, noted that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust are already likely to be united\n",
      "British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana\n",
      "The break-up of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft\n",
      "Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft\n",
      "``Exxon would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors, the way Microsoft is,'' he said\n",

      "Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the two assailants and injured 21 Israelis\n",
      "The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility\n",
      "David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas\n",
      "Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas' military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic Jihad were outlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996\n",
      "But Bar-Illan said the Palestinian legislature had never passed such a law\n",
      "``Why did Mr\n",
      "Arafat agree in the Wye accord to outlaw them if he has already done it?'' he asked\n",
      "The Wye memorandum states that the Palestinian Authority ``will inform the United States fully of the actions it has taken to outlaw all organizations (or wings of organizations, as appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent character, and their support structure and to prevent them freedom of action in the areas under its jurisdiction.'' A Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting was held Saturday night to discuss security in the wake of Friday's attack\n",
      "Participants included the head of the Palestinian intelligence, Amin Hindi, and the head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Dahlan\n",
      "The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was brought up in the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat during a phone call, the official said\n",
      "The Palestinians said they could ban activity by Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, but could not outlaw them outright as political movements\n",
      "Friday's bombing led to finger-pointing by both sides\n",
      "Israel said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorists had not been sweeping enough\n",
      "The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel of failing to take at least partial security responsibility for the attack, because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled areas, and had recently served time in Israeli jails\n",
      "Israel as a rule is harshly critical of the Palestinian Authority's security efforts when attackers come from Palestinian-controlled areas or have been released from Palestinian prisons\n",

      "Groundbreaking at the site led to angry Palestinian protests and a breakdown of peace talks in March 1997\n",

      "Relatives said he was an impressionable teen-ager, influenced by Islamic militants with whom he was jailed\n",
      "Sughayer came out of prison more devout, and hardened by mistreatment at the hands of the Israelis, relatives said\n",
      "His cellmates taught him the doctrine of holy war and about the glories of martyrdom, said an older brother, Samih Sughayer\n",
      "``They sowed it in his heart,'' he said\n",

      "``He would joke about things and say that whatever happens is God's will,'' said a brother-in-law, who insisted on anonymity\n",
      "``He was an easygoing guy.'' Last Thursday, Sughayer bought a battered red Fiat and parked it near his house\n",
      "When someone at home asked about the car he said nothing, and family members assumed it was one of the stolen vehicles often found here\n",
      "On Friday morning he left with the car, meeting his brother-in-law and old jail buddy, Suleiman Tahayneh, who came from his village near the West Bank town of Jenin\n",

      "With this and other fund-raising programs, the committee says it has amassed $62 million for the elections\n",
      "But campaign finance watchdogs say the solicitations mark a new departure in political fund raising, one they call akin to the practices of marketing companies like the Publishers' Clearing House that hook consumers with visions of million-dollar windfalls to induce them to subscribe to magazines\n",

Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in election law and represents both Democratic and Republican clients, said, ``I have never heard of that particular device.'' But it doesn't appear illegal, he said, adding, ``It's a fund-raising gimmick to get attention.'' Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit, nonpartisan advocate of campaign finance reform, said, ``This is a new version of caveat emptor _ buyer be damned instead of buyer beware.'' When businesses do it, he added, Congress orders investigations\n",

      "``He is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by as much as half, and he's also interested in legislation to cut capital gains to a single rate of 15 percent.'' To assure passage of the legislation, the speaker wants to increase his Republican majority, she says, adding, ``To help us do that, the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals such as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on his advisory council.'' Nancy continues: ``There will be correspondence with the speaker, such as conference calls\n",
      "It's a great way that he can get your input and thoughts on legislation that does concern you\n",
      "Or maybe surveys or questionnaires.'' Later, Nancy says: ``As a member of his committee, you would be receiving from the speaker our national leadership award, which is really quite an honor\n",
      "And to be honest, he will be asking each of our chairmen if they could help our efforts to increase our majority with a one-time contribution of $500 or $1,000\n",
      "``Now that would be used on the nationwide media campaign that Newt has undertaken to target those seats we really need\n",
      "And as someone who I'm sure would also benefit from this, could I tell the speaker he could count on your help?'' The doctor demurs\n",
      "``I am a registered, you know, Republican in Kansas,'' she tells Nancy\n",
      "``Probably if I were to do something it would be to go through my own representative.'' Then the doctor tries to ascertain where Nancy is located\n",

      "``The speaker's office,'' says Nancy\n",

      "Harris said the calls are ``in no way related to the speaker's OFFICIAL office.'' He added: ``What is more important is not where the calls get routed\n",

      "Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation\n",

      "They also raised the possibility that the group would endorse both candidates, or remain neutral\n",
      "If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three major factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching for allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record on gay issues to be quite strong\n",
      "An endorsement by the group, which is held in high regard by many gay and lesbian voters, could prove important in swinging voters to D'Amato in a tight race\n",
      "It would also be a major symbolic victory for the senator, who has sought to recast himself as a centrist in recent years and could use the endorsement to build his standing among moderate swing voters\n",
      "A D'Amato endorsement would also weaken Schumer's efforts to portray the incumbent as a right-wing extremist and would signify to many voters a fraying of the traditional Democratic coalition that has included black and gay voters, women and labor unions\n",
      "The intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see defeating D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the Republicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate _ enough to stop a Democratic filibuster\n",
      "The Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 majority\n",
      "``There is sentiment in the community that if the Republicans get 60 votes, that Trent Lott will basically be in charge politically for the next two years,'' said David Mixner, a close friend of President Clinton's who is gay\n",
      "He was referring to the Senate majority leader, who has called homosexuality a sin and likened it to kleptomania\n",
      "Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda\n",
      "Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan, it has been very close to the Clinton administration, has many Democrats on its board and receives much of its money from Democratic contributors\n",
      "Largely because of the group's strong Democratic ties, gay Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials are infuriated that it is even considering endorsing D'Amato, who also runs on the Right to Life and Conservative Party lines and often receives high ratings from the Christian Coalition, which typically opposes legislation on civil rights for gay people\n",
      "Although the organization has been thought to be inching toward a D'Amato endorsement for months, the lobbying campaign for Schumer has picked up intensity in the last two weeks, driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer than ever\n",
      "Democrats and advocates in both parties who support rights for gay people said that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary for Health and Human Services Donna Shalala have made personal appeals to Human Rights Campaign officials urging them not to endorse D'Amato\n",
      "White House officials said they did not know whether the three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials declined to comment\n",
      "Schumer met privately with the group's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement\n",
      "Clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing the group's board members at every opportunity, from cocktail parties to fund-raisers, raising concerns about a D'Amato endorsement\n",
      "Some New York advocates of civil rights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls, e-mail messages and letters\n",
      "Democratic officials have been encouraging the group's major donors to express their opposition to D'Amato\n",
      "People involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best, they are hoping the group will endorse both candidates, or make no endorsement at all\n",
      "``Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are important to gay communities,'' said a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity\n",
      "``The last thing that they should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so supportive of their agenda.'' The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million\n",
      "The group was created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan\n",
      "Paradoxically, D'Amato was first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained a strong supporter of President Reagan\n",
      "For D'Amato, who has aggressively courted gay voters, the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate\n",
      "Since 1993, the senator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military, sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers and opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration\n",
      "To gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close to the Democratic Party\n",
      "Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, including top officials within the Human Rights Campaign, contend that in the current political climate, where Congress is almost certain to remain under Republican control after November, gay people must build alliances with moderate Republicans\n",
      "Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents, even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues\n",
      "That is the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human Rights Campaign has been consistently better than D'Amato's\n",
      "Both men, however, have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages\n",
      "In a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporters, the organization endorsed Sen\n",

      "Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger, William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's record on gay rights was considered stronger\n",
      "The move angered gay Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that the group is biased toward Democrats\n",
      "But there is clearly a large number of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage the group, particularly among women\n",
      "They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit the group in droves because D'Amato has never wavered in his opposition to abortion during 18 years in Congress\n",
      "Many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses D'Amato, whom they blame for installing the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay\n",
      "Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role as ``the architect'' of the state Republican Party as a major reason the group endorsed Schumer\n",
      "``While he has criticized fellow Republicans in Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's blatant discrimination is still the order of the day,'' Foreman said\n",
      "For that reason, some White House officials say they think a Human Rights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost meaningless among gay voters\n",
      "They contend that it might even hurt the senator among his conservative base\n",
      "``I don't think anybody will vote for Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement,'' said a White House aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity\n",

      "Other Democratic incumbents who Republican officials cite as locked in contests that are more competitive than expected include Reps\n",
      "Corrine Brown of Florida, Vic Snyder of Arkansas, Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher of California, Martin Frost of Texas, Melvin Watt of North Carolina, John LaFalce of New York and Sander Levin of Michigan\n",
      "Here in North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price, acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a tight race, said: ``This is a swing district that is sensitive to any tide or trend\n",
      "It's something you think about a lot in connection with the president's troubles.'' The efforts of Price and Mrs\n",
      "Carson to contain the Lewinsky debacle _ and their opponents' attempts to capitalize on it _ offer important clues suggesting how Clinton's problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country\n",
      "Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them, and yet, sensing the possibility of a public backlash against Republicans, they are weighing their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon\n",
      "And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them, their campaigns are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind-the-efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote\n",
      "In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, the challengers in the Price and Carson districts _ both are political novices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies: Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price, has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal\n",
      "``Tom Roberg has called for Bill Clinton's resignation,'' the narrator says\n",

      "Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he notes as often as he can that ``Julia votes with Clinton almost 100 percent of the time.'' Asked why he was not much raising the scandal directly, Hofmeister said: ``Don't murder somebody when they're in the process of committing suicide\n",
      "There would be a danger if we went overboard.'' The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and Mrs\n",
      "Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they would want Clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a visit\n",
      "What if there was a sudden schedule change? Both paused, squirmed a bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative\n",
      "``Given the president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me,'' Mrs\n",
      "Carson said\n",
      "And Price? ``I don't think that would be such a good idea,'' he said\n",
      "``I've never had a president campaign here, and I wouldn't want to start this time'' although he is eagerly welcoming Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and a popular native son in North Carolina, to stump with him here this Sunday.) Making strategy for the stump is further complicated by anecdotal evidence that runs counter to Democratic fears and Republican hopes\n",
      "In three days of campaign stops here in North Carolina and in Indianapolis, the scandal was rarely raised by any voter being courted by the candidates of either party\n",
      "When a reporter asked about it, many voters said that as appalled as they were at Clinton's behavior, they had a hard time relating it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections in five weeks\n",
      "As Hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside a gun and knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis last Sunday, Billy Derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who is retired on disability, called him over to express outrage about the millions of dollars that had been spent to investigate Clinton\n",
      "``It's pathetic to spend all of our money,'' said Derringer, who identified himself as an independent\n",
      "``It shouldn't have gotten this far.'' Hofmeister tried his best to make the Republicans' case\n",
      "``There has to be rule of law,'' he said\n",
      "Mrs\n",
      "Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing voters alike would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that the issue might even help her\n",
      "To that end, she proudly informs audiences that she voted against making public the report delivered to the House by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel\n",
      "``I was one of 63 members of Congress who voted against putting all that filth on the Internet,'' she said, adding that Starr's inquiry had been ``a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility and accountability.'' The Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy Daly, a 38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a Republican two years ago but now favors Mrs\n",
      "Carson\n",
      "``I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because I'm tired of it: the right side of the Republican Party is playing politics,'' Daly said\n",
      "``We'd like to see them go on with the people's business.'' Back here in the 4th District, Price has some reasons to be worried\n",
      "He was first elected to the House in 1986 but, as a four-term incumbent, was ousted in the Republican sweep of 1994 (only to win his seat back two years later)\n",
      "In addition, the district was redrawn last year to include a large Durham section where voters do not know him well\n",
      "Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Clinton once again, Price says he is waging the most vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career\n",
      "Rather than engage Roberg over the Clinton scandal, Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education\n",
      "The congressman's advisers say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical _ it features school children in a play _ in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal\n",
      "But the Price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve, in the event Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage: the incumbent's advisers say they would not be timid about running commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science\n",
      "At a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of Raleigh the other night, Roberg opened his remarks by asserting that Clinton had ``lost the moral authority to lead.'' Yet none of those assembled asked him about the scandal; they were more concerned about the state's plans to build a highway near their neighborhood\n",

      "Although it may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky\n",
      "Largely as a result of the Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will gain a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate, where the Republicans have 55 seats to the Democrats' 45\n",
      "For labor leaders like Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican majority is a nightmare\n",
      "That fear has helped push other New York unions into Schumer's column, even though D'Amato had long courted them\n",
      "Those unions include the teamsters' joint council in New York City and District Council 37, an umbrella group representing 120,000 municipal employees\n",
      "Labor leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently defeated Republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board\n",
      "``We are worried about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive into the next century,'' Rivera said\n",
      "Alarmed that the Democrats will lose Senate seats in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South Carolina, Rivera's union concluded that it was worth backing Schumer\n",
      "The decision, Rivera emphasized repeatedly, was not personal but was based on national considerations\n",
      "``Unfortunately, the leadership of the Republican Party at the national level in the person of Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott are not necessarily from the same culture as the Republicans of the Northeast,'' he said\n",
      "``They're far more conservative, far more anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business\n",
      "We fear that the Democratic Party faces irrelevance in the United States Senate if we go below 41 seats.'' Trying to avoid a rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praised him as ``an effective senator.'' The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer\n",
      "Rivera's union and the teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in New York\n",
      "In addition, Schumer will get thousands of dollars from the local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can make 50,000 political calls a day\n",
      "A spokesman for D'Amato said, ``Al D'Amato's proud that he's been endorsed by over 100 union federations and locals, representing more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll continue his efforts on behalf of working middle class families.'' His labor endorsements include the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council\n",
      "Besides the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has 350,000 members in New York State\n",
      "Rivera _ who did not support D'Amato the last time he ran either _ announced the endorsements during the founding convention of the New York State Council of the service employees union\n",

      "White House officials said they did not know whether the three had made such appeals, and Human Rights Campaign officials declined to comment\n",
      "Schumer met privately with the group's top officials last week to make one last pitch for the endorsement\n",
      "Clinton administration officials have also been buttonholing the group's board members at every opportunity, from cocktail parties to fund-raisers, raising concerns about a D'Amato endorsement\n",
      "Some New York advocates of civil rights for gay people have flooded the organization with phone calls, e-mail messages and letters\n",
      "Democratic officials have been encouraging the group's major donors to express their opposition to D'Amato\n",
      "People involved in the lobbying efforts said that at best, they are hoping the group will endorse both candidates, or make no endorsement at all\n",
      "``Chuck Schumer has been a strong supporter of issues that are important to gay communities,'' said a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity\n",
      "``The last thing that they should want to do is hurt the candidacy of someone who has been so supportive of their agenda.'' The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million\n",
      "The group was created in the early 1980s in large part to counter the rise of the Christian right and Ronald Reagan\n",
      "Paradoxically, D'Amato was first elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 and remained a strong supporter of President Reagan\n",
      "For D'Amato, who has aggressively courted gay voters, the endorsement would represent a crowning achievement in his efforts to reposition himself as a moderate\n",
      "Since 1993, the senator has backed the right of gay citizens to serve in the military, sponsored legislation to prevent job discrimination against gay workers and opposed his own leadership's attempts to block the nominations of two openly gay men to positions in the Clinton administration\n",
      "To gay supporters of D'Amato, an endorsement by the Human Rights Campaign would signify the political maturation of the gay electorate and help the organization insulate itself from accusations that it is too close to the Democratic Party\n",
      "Those who support a D'Amato endorsement, including top officials within the Human Rights Campaign, contend that in the current political climate, where Congress is almost certain to remain under Republican control after November, gay people must build alliances with moderate Republicans\n",
      "Human Rights Campaign officials also say their standing policy is to support friendly incumbents, even when their challengers have better voting records on gay issues\n",
      "That is the case in New York, where Schumer's rating by the Human Rights Campaign has been consistently better than D'Amato's\n",
      "Both men, however, have angered advocates of rights for gay people by voting for legislation that allows states to not recognize gay marriages\n",
      "In a precedent widely cited by D'Amato supporters, the organization endorsed Sen\n",
      "John F\n",
      "Kerry, a Democrat, over the Republican challenger, William Weld, in the 1996 Massachusetts Senate race, even though Weld's record on gay rights was considered stronger\n",
      "The move angered gay Republicans, who now contend that snubbing D'Amato would prove that the group is biased toward Democrats\n",
      "But there is clearly a large number of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing D'Amato will permanently damage the group, particularly among women\n",
      "They fear that abortion rights supporters will quit the group in droves because D'Amato has never wavered in his opposition to abortion during 18 years in Congress\n",
      "Many New York gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses D'Amato, whom they blame for installing the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, whom they consider to be strongly anti-gay\n",
      "Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role as ``the architect'' of the state Republican Party as a major reason the group endorsed Schumer\n",
      "``While he has criticized fellow Republicans in Washington for their intolerance, here at home, his own party's blatant discrimination is still the order of the day,'' Foreman said\n",
      "For that reason, some White House officials say they think a Human Rights Campaign endorsement of D'Amato will be almost meaningless among gay voters\n",
      "They contend that it might even hurt the senator among his conservative base\n",
      "``I don't think anybody will vote for Al D'Amato because of an HRC endorsement,'' said a White House aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity\n",
      "``But I think some people in the Right to Life Party and some upstate people are going to say, `Who is this guy and why should we vote for him?''' \n",

      "Clinton has stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he has taken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' needs\n",
      "He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers\n",
      "In one deft sentence, he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country's economic strength, making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland\n",
      "After thanking the gathered donors for the ``very kind personal things'' they had said to him, the president declared, ``If I had to do it all over again, every day, I would do it in a heartbeat, to see America where it is today as compared to six years ago.'' As the applause died away, Clinton continued, ``I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live with the consequences of our mistakes in life.'' He added with a chuckle: ``Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public way\n",
      "But nobody gets out of life for free.'' To the music of a saxophone and a hammered dulcimer, Clinton raised about $200,000 over lunch in a private home in Cleveland for the Democratic Senate candidate in Ohio, Mary Boyle\n",
      "Then he flew to Philadelphia to raise half a million dollars for the Democratic Party\n",
      "By midsummer, the president's aides were delighted to have persuaded him to condense his fund-raising remarks to just 10 minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing\n",
      "But as his troubles have grown and the mid-term elections have approached, his free-form remarks have become longer\n",
      "In Cleveland on Friday, he spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost 20 minutes\n",
      "These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug\n",

      "But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters who were scattered along the president's motorcade route were reminders of calls for his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some are heaping upon his presidency\n",
      "At a rally for the president outside city hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, ``two more years.'' Clinton's motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds of people, some of them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs\n",
      "After an impromptu shopping trip, during which he was greeted with shouts of ``We love you,'' Clinton told some donors at the beginning of an impassioned reprise of his Cleveland speech: ``I didn't even mind the protesters, that's the American way.'' But, he added, he preferred it when they were in the minority, ``and that seemed to be the case.'' As he rode into Cleveland, Clinton passed a billboard for a local radio station, WNCX\n",
      "``Lovin', touchin', squeezin','' it read, the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with his arm over Ms\n",
      "Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside them\n",
      "The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington\n",

      "As he typically does now before such partisan audiences, he also walked through his political calculation for the mid-term elections\n",
      "Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans had bragged privately to him about their prospects\n",
      "``They tell me, `Oh, we're going to do very well, Mr\n",
      "President, in these mid-terms because we have so much more money than you do,''' and because Democrats who turned out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the polls in an off-year\n",
      "That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote\n",

      "``The people that were good enough to serve you here at this event today, they've got a lot of hassles in their life,'' he said\n",
      "But, he said, ``adversity is our friend,'' because it can overcome apathy and ``focus us on what is at issue here.'' What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievements and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly\n",
      "``What have they done?'' he asked in Cleveland\n",

      "But impeachment is another matter; most polls show the nation is against it\n",
      "The danger for Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility, the debate may move beyond the president's behavior _ about which there is little disagreement _ to the more problematic issue of whether he should be removed from office\n",
      "For most of the strategists involved in the races, there is little guidance on how to handle the impeachment issue\n",

      "``It's not that we don't know, and that the politicians don't know, where the general public stands on impeachment\n",
      "The problem is that we don't know where the electorate stands on impeachment.'' And asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots in a Senate race is, in the words of Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant, ``a double bank-shot.'' Such strategies, he said, tend to work only with a small number of single-minded or sophisticated voters\n",
      "Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate\n",
      "If Democrats try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage, it would be in states with a Democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters, who overwhelmingly support the president\n",
      "In contests like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic candidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment\n",
      "Strategists in both parties believe that kind of approach could prove effective\n",
      "``This is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites and the public,'' said Fred Yang, a Democratic consultant with clients in Wisconsin and the Carolinas\n",
      "That kind of Democratic strategy might emerge in California, New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Washington and perhaps Arkansas\n",
      "By contrast, Democrats in South Carolina, Georgia and Nevada would be less likely to oppose Clinton's impeachment\n",
      "On the other side, Republican consultants are telling their candidates to stress Clinton's misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment\n",
      "The last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate elections into a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced from office\n",
      "``The White House might think from the overall public numbers that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election,'' said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who is working in Senate races this year\n",

      "1, Malaysia discontinued trading in its currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly on investment from overseas\n",
      "In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy that President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to champion\n",
      "Mahathir's decision drew jeers from international investors and policy- makers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix that would retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the odd man out when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise\n",
      "Now, though, Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund economy\n",
      "Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly in September, and there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again\n",
      "``It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls, the economy has improved,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research organization here that helped draft the policies\n",
      "``But we want to see whether this is strongly sustainable.'' Critics said it was predictable that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy\n",
      "Because the country is sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows and currency fluctuations, they said, the government had been able to ease interest rates and encourage consumer spending\n",
      "Still, the mere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some positive results guarantees that the issue will come up during the APEC meeting\n",
      "With Mahathir leading the campaign, the cause of capital controls will have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for getting under the skin of Westerners\n",
      "``Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,'' said Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore\n",
      "``There is no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to muzzle him,'' he added, referring to President Jiang of China\n",
      "Policy-makers in the United States have expressed fears that if Malaysia's gambit is seen as successful, other economically weakened countries in the region, like Indonesia, might be tempted to try it\n",
      "So far, Indonesian officials have said they would stick to the recovery plan devised by the International Monetary Fund, which stresses economic austerity and open markets\n",
      "But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy for Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has advocated using them as an emergency measure\n",
      "Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global financial system\n",
      "He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent American hedge fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can have destructive consequences\n",
      "The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in Greenwich, Conn., was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on Treasury securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted a flight of capital out of that country\n",
      "``The LTCM fiasco really provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy,'' Yusof said\n",
      "With capital controls as protection, Yusof said Malaysia was picking up the pieces of its shattered economy\n",
      "In addition to growing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods\n",
      "Foreign investors have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, as experts had predicted they would\n",
      "While foreign direct investment fell in September _ to $142 million, from an average monthly rate of $321 million for the period from January through September _ it did not dry up completely\n",
      "For every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an alarming one\n",
      "They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated that Malaysian currency held outside the country would be worthless unless repatriated by Sept\n",
      "30\n",
      "The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in September, despite several reductions in interest rates\n",
      "So the consumers who are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into their savings, which means the buying spree will end when their savings are depleted\n",
      "``The argument was that by imposing capital controls, you'd regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch,'' said K.S\n",
      "Jomo, a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here\n",
      "``But that's not happening.'' The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy, Jomo and others said, is its timing\n",
      "With the Asian crisis more than a year old, much of the foreign capital that was in the country has already gone\n",
      "The critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors without even locking in the ones who used to be here\n",
      "``There is a case to be made for the temporary imposition of capital controls, but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one,'' Jomo said\n",
      "In fact, other Asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht, have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended trading in its currency and fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit to the dollar\n",
      "Analysts liken the situation to buying an insurance policy for a disaster that has come and gone\n",
      "More important, the capital controls are slowing down much-needed corporate and banking reforms\n",
      "The government's rescue of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, is going ahead, though some analysts predict the government will eventually scrap the much-criticized plan\n",

      "On Monday, during the trial of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges of corruption and sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's claim that he had approved the bailout\n",
      "Anwar's sensational trial is a reminder that Mahathir's economic policies cannot be disentangled from politics\n",
      "Malaysia's 72-year-old prime minister clashed with his former protege over how to respond to the Asian crisis, and he dismissed Anwar the day after imposing capital controls\n",
      "During boom times, Mahathir won support for his policies by wrapping them in anti-foreigner language\n",
      "In a speech on Monday, he attacked a familiar target, saying foreign currency traders ``are the cause of the currency turmoil,'' adding: ``They spread it worldwide\n",
      "They precipitated the current recession in every country.'' But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia\n",
      "With protesters chanting for reform on the usually orderly streets of this city, experts said Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order to soothe the country's agitated population\n",
      "``Things will heat up if the economy does not improve,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science at the University of Malaya\n",

      "Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop\n",

      "The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another\n",
      "The contracts with manufacturers and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems\n",
      "The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department\n",
      "Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software platform on which other programs run\n",
      "So contracts intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly\n",
      "Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary\n",
      "Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous\n",
      "No one, he said, ``would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts.'' His point, shared widely among economists, is that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs\n",
      "But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power\n",
      "The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute\n",
      "Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers\n",
      "The Justice Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle: yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition\n",
      "So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment\n",

      "Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers\n",
      "Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department, which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside its own\n",
      "But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because they offered no consumer benefit\n",

      "Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits against hypothetical long-term harm\n",
      "Rule argues that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits\n",

      "The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products\n",
      "The Justice Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow\n",
      "The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers\n",
      "Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test\n",
      "But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is up for grabs\n",
      "A balancing test would have the courts weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers and operating systems\n",

      "Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later\n",

      "Relying heavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape executive vice president Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of Barksdale, prosecutors are expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal had several elements, both incentives and requirements\n",
      "Microsoft, according to the people questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operating systems so that Netscape's software would run better on Windows\n",
      "In return, the people say, Netscape would give Microsoft a seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft, give Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts and not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating system, Windows 95, which was shipped two months after the June 1995 meeting\n",
      "And Microsoft, the people added, did what it has always denied it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in business negotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to the Windows ``application program interfaces,'' or APIs, the links that enable other companies' programs to run smoothly on the Windows operating system\n",
      "By turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have that preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft fiercely denies making\n",
      "Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told a colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 was ``the damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 years in business.'' Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had Microsoft's money and its endorsement\n",
      "Netscape would have also been free to sell its browser for use in earlier versions of Windows and for use on other operating systems like Apple's Macintosh and Unix, a powerful system used mainly in corporations and research labs\n",

      "``We didn't start Netscape for that.'' For any company, a meeting with Microsoft is often a charged affair\n",
      "Every computing device from keyboards to disk drives, and every software program from games to browsers, must mesh smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system\n",
      "This is necessary to make computers reliable and easier to use, but it also gives Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper\n",
      "And since Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against it\n",
      "And in the software industry, where every program is rendered in the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition and cooperation are often blurred\n",
      "The talk about that line at the Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the operating system _ the ``platform,'' in computer terms _ and the application programs, sometimes called ``solutions,'' that run on top of the operating system\n",
      "The government suit states that in sworn testimony, Chris Jones, a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, ``admitted that Microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to compete.'' Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence mainly of the company's clarifying its position\n",
      "If Netscape stayed on the applications or solutions side of the operating system, the two companies could be partners, Microsoft said\n",
      "But if Netscape tried to become a player in the platform space, they would compete\n",

      "But again, persuade in the sense of force or persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have a great business relationship together\n",
      "Later in the deposition, a Justice Department lawyer asked Jones whether any of the Microsoft executives intended to suggest that ``there would be any consequences to Netscape or its business if Netscape chose to go in the platform direction you've described earlier as opposed to the solutions direction.'' Jones replied: ``The conversation was something like the following: `We're in the platform business\n",
      "We're going to invest heavily in this part of the platform because we feel it's critical to our technologies\n",
      "That's a done deal.' And we're asking them: `What is your business? Is your business platforms or solutions? If it's platforms, we're in the platforms business\n",
      "We're competing.''' Microsoft portrays such comments as innocuous statements of fact\n",
      "But to Netscape, the same remarks could be taken as a warning, if not a threat\n",
      "This is because Internet browsing software had the potential to become an alternative platform to the Windows operating system\n",
      "The browser, sitting on top of the operating system, could supplant Windows as the main desktop screen on users' machines and the main layer of programming for starting other software applications\n",
      "In addition, Netscape's browser could serve as a powerful platform for distributing and running Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc., a Microsoft rival\n",
      "In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing\n",
      "Indeed, Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to relegate Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath the browser\n",
      "By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape as a serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown jewel\n",
      "On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, ``The Internet Tidal Wave,'' Gates wrote: ``A new competitor `born' on the Internet is Netscape\n",
      "Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share, allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch on.'' Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, was to ``move the key API'' into the browser ``to commoditize the underlying operating system.'' THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING The federal government and the states have recently broadened their allegations against Microsoft by adding evidence that it tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc\n",

      "They say that like the Netscape meeting the new evidence fits a pattern of behavior by Microsoft, which has repeatedly tried to limit competition by strong-arming competitors and partners\n",
      "One episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend, was an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation with Netscape\n",
      "Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run the Windows operating system\n",
      "Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and Microsoft are so closely aligned that the two companies are sometimes referred to as a single, powerful entity, ``Wintel.'' But Intel also employs hundreds of software engineers, mainly at its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore\n",
      "And while Intel and Microsoft are partners, they have also had their conflicts, typically over the direction and pace at which certain innovations should be introduced into the personal computer industry, which they dominate together\n",
      "Federal and state investigators have focused on Microsoft's strong reaction to work being done by Intel's software engineers _ a sentiment expressed in no uncertain terms during a meeting at Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters on Aug\n",
      "2, 1995\n",
      "The contentious session was attended by several executives from Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and Intel chairman Andrew Grove\n",
      "An internal Intel memo stated that Gates made ``vague threats'' about supporting Intel's competitors and that he was ``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in the Internet and wanted them stopped.'' Later, Intel did pull back from its multimedia and Internet software development\n",
      "Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president who attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to appear as a witness for the government\n",
      "Microsoft replies that the government's accounts of meetings like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful distortions, created by using a biased selection of documents and witnesses\n",
      "The government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter failure to accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meets with companies to make sure their software and equipment will work well with Windows\n",
      "Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on to include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology or a Microsoft investment, as the company discussed with Netscape\n",
      "In the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the browser market was the result of its own business acumen and Netscape's missteps\n",
      "To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft issued a subpoena last month and obtained the unpublished manuscript of a new book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,'' which is based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape executives\n",
      "The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape\n",
      "But its authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the Harvard Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless\n",
      "``Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but inviting retaliation from competitors, the government and even customers,'' Yoffie said\n",
      "Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie added, ``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what it did without crossing the line as much as it did.'' THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 Microsoft executives gathered for a daylong retreat not far from the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash\n",
      "The subject was the Internet and how it might revolutionize the computer software business\n",
      "Few concrete plans were made that day, but Microsoft executives insist that a direction was set\n",
      "``Our vision from the outset was to unite the two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet,'' said Steven Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting\n",
      "Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape in the browser field\n",
      "To hasten its entry, Microsoft licensed its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc\n",
      "of Naperville, Ill\n",
      "The first meeting between the two companies was initiated by Spyglass in April 1994\n",
      "At the time, it was a tiny company and eager to do a deal with Microsoft\n",
      "Spyglass was selected as the commercial licensee for browser technology developed by the National Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois\n",
      "In the summer of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass, met with Clark of Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago\n",
      "The two men talked in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room, reserved for business-class passengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark telling him, ``We're going to take Microsoft head-on.'' At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking to himself, ``Great, now Microsoft will really want to license from me.'' Today, he noted: ``Remember, we were a company with a couple dozen people and almost no money in the bank\n",
      "Netscape had Jim Clark, with his money and reputation, and big-time venture capital backing from Silicon Valley\n",
      "Netscape had a very different agenda.'' By July 1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, and the two companies signed their first licensing agreement the following December\n",
      "Microsoft, Colbeth recalls, always told him that it would eventually fold browser technology into its operating system, but its timing was accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise\n",
      "``Microsoft was initially hoping to charge for the browser,'' Colbeth said\n",
      "But on Dec\n",
      "7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not only deeply integrate its browser into Windows but would give it away\n",
      "The announcement caught the industry, even Colbeth, by surprise\n",
      "At the time, Spyglass had licensed its technology to 82 other companies, including IBM and Digital Equipment, for use in their software products _ a licensing revenue stream of about $20 million a year\n",
      "As a result of Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw those revenues vanish within a year, as smaller Internet software companies went out of business and big customers shifted to Microsoft's free browser\n",
      "Spyglass slashed its payroll and scrambled into new niches of the software industry to replace its lost sales, which it succeeded in doing eventually\n",
      "``Whenever you license technology to Microsoft, you have to understand it can someday build it itself, drop it into the operating system and put you out of that business,'' Colbeth said\n",
      "THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market continued to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though its browser was free\n",
      "Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed that Netscape's browser was the clear technical leader\n",
      "In April 1996, Netscape's Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the Web, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, according to Zona Research\n",
      "So the biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought it made sense to give customers Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's\n",
      "But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and Compaq had no choice but to give in\n",
      "In June 1996, Compaq wanted not only to load the more popular Netscape browser on its machines but also to remove the icon for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was delivered to the computer maker with Windows 95\n",
      "Microsoft informed Compaq that if it removed Internet Explorer, the computer maker would lose its license for Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director of software procurement, in testimony to federal investigators\n",
      "The ultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter headed, ``Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement.'' Faced with being denied the essential operating system, Compaq quickly reversed course and kept the Internet Explorer icon\n",
      "Microsoft asserts that Windows and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone defines what is in the product\n",
      "Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibits computer makers from including competing technologies\n",
      "While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing with its largest corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold insists that ``to take one letter here or one snippet of e-mail there to try to portray Microsoft as an arrogant company is unfair.'' Noting that a Compaq executive is a witness for Microsoft, Herbold said, ``We are totally dependent on tremendous relationships with key companies like Compaq.'' At Netscape, however, the Compaq episode was a watershed\n",
      "``That was the singular act that got me going to the Justice Department,'' Barksdale recalled\n",
      "Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq to buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential product, the Windows operating system, as ``an illegal act and absolute proof that Microsoft was a monopolist.'' After investigating the incident, the Justice Department and the states agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft was illegally tying the sale of one product to another\n",
      "Microsoft replies that it has a long history of adding new features to its operating system\n",
      "And from the outset, Microsoft says, it intended that Windows and its Internet Explorer browser would be seamlessly integrated, as they are now in Windows 98\n",
      "Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no product-tying violation of antitrust laws\n",
      "In a separate case, a federal appeals court sided with Microsoft, upholding the principle that the company could put whatever it wanted to in its operating system and declare it a single product\n",
      "But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different software programs\n",
      "``It took a long time for the integration strategy to play out,'' said a former senior Microsoft researcher\n",
      "``Back then, integration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows.'' THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL America Online chairman Stephen Case refers to dealing with Microsoft as ``a delicate balancing act.'' That balance swung sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996, when Microsoft used the lure of giving America Online a featured place on the Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip\n",
      "To gain access to computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online subscribers, who now number more than 13 million\n",
      "Yet throughout 1995, as Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows 95, the most significant improvement ever in its operating system, Case was knocking on the door of the Justice Department\n",
      "His complaint was that Microsoft was going to place its new online service, Microsoft Network, a direct competitor to America Online, prominently on the desktop screen of Windows 95, which was introduced in August\n",
      "This bundling tactic of using the industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network, or MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young but fast-growing online business\n",
      "The Justice Department listened and investigated\n",
      "But ultimately, the government decided against taking any action\n",
      "At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft was both feared and loathed at the time\n",
      "America Online had a designated ``Microsoft watcher,'' a young M.B.A\n",
      "who tracked its adversary's every move\n",
      "Above the desk in his small, windowless office was a picture of Gates\n",
      "Beneath the picture, in large block letters, were the words ``THE ENEMY.'' Though America Online was the clear leader in the online services business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out assault by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft\n",
      "When he had visited the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case recalled, Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options by saying he could buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the online business on his own and ``bury you.'' A threat or merely a statement of the facts? ``A bit of both,'' Case said recently\n",
      "``But he was mainly articulating what everybody at that meeting kind of intuitively understood.'' Yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason to cooperate\n",
      "With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World Wide Web, the conventional online companies, like America Online and Compuserve, had to provide their customers Internet access as well as their own services\n",
      "America Online had its own browser, but to keep pace with the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to do a deal with Netscape or Microsoft\n",
      "For both software companies, a deal with America Online, which had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge in browser use and market share\n",
      "Netscape seemed the natural partner for America Online, since both companies were Microsoft rivals\n",
      "On March 11, America Online did announce that it would buy Netscape technology, but it was a standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula\n",
      "The next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with Microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked for Netscape's Navigator\n",
      "To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give America Online a start-up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely the kind of equal treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had asked the Justice Department to require of Microsoft\n",
      "``After we agreed to its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled on the Windows desktop,'' Case said\n",
      "``It was an example of Microsoft's pragmatic side.'' The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate goal was to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay software business\n",
      "As a result, its new online service, MSN, would have to sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival, America Online\n",
      "``It was Bill's decision,'' said former MSN general manager Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates\n",
      "``He sent me e-mail on it\n",
      "He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much\n",
      "I disagreed with him.'' To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed a different view of the likely impact on MSN\n",
      "He told senior vice president Brad Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would amount to ``putting a bullet through MSN's head,'' according to a deposition taken by the Justice Department\n",
      "In the antitrust suit, the government asserts that the America Online deal shows how Microsoft used the power of its Windows monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against Netscape\n",
      "David Colburn, a senior vice president of America Online who took part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, is a witness for the government\n",
      "Today, Microsoft has overhauled its Internet strategy to focus mainly on building popular special-interest Web sites in fields like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing and news\n",
      "And it is putting these sites, along with e-mail and search features, in an all-in-one site that uses the name MSN.com\n",
      "``I still regard Microsoft as a primary threat,'' Case observed\n",
      "``Microsoft has a history of getting it right in the long run, and there's no reason to think it won't in this business as well\n",
      "We will always be in Microsoft's cross hairs.'' THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today is one of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever possible\n",
      "``Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path _ that's the lesson learned,'' observed Clark, the Netscape chairman\n",
      "Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, the investors who finance so many of the nation's high-tech startups, generally follow the Netscape formula these days\n",
      "Yet that still leaves ample room to prosper\n",
      "For while competing directly with Microsoft is dangerous, the software industry as a whole is an engine of wealth creation, job generation and technical innovation\n",
      "And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's relationship with Microsoft\n",
      "For if a start-up cannot steer clear of Microsoft entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by Microsoft, which has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way of acquiring promising technology and people\n",
      "``Microsoft understands start-up innovation and how to co-opt start-up innovation better than any other high-tech company,'' said James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm\n",
      "As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be seen not merely as a competitor but as a force of nature that shapes the business environment, like a weather front\n",
      "``Microsoft is incredibly pervasive,'' said Stewart Alsop, a partner with New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif\n",
      "At the board meetings of the companies in which his firm has invested, two issues always come up, he said: ``One is the price of the company's stock, and the other is what Microsoft is going to do.'' In the last few years, Microsoft has offered its guidance during almost yearly meetings between senior Microsoft executives and leading venture capitalists\n",
      "The meetings are part of Microsoft's effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations with Silicon Valley\n",
      "``We work hard to provide clarity about where we're going and where we're not going,'' said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer\n",
      "Last year's conference took place in October at the Quadrus office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the Wall Street of high-tech venture investing\n",
      "Maffei led a team of five Microsoft executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists, one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the minds of many of his peers: ``How do I invest in a company that stays out of the way of the steamroller?'' Maffei, recalled one person who attended the meeting, stood up and delivered a brief lecture on businesses that Microsoft was likely to avoid\n",
      "His list included specialized software for manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design and others\n",
      "But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software platforms that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer operating system\n",
      "At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional Venture Partners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, and said quietly, ``I guess that leaves us washing machines and toasters.'' \n",
      "Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp\n",
      "in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon Valley executive\n",
      "The executive recalls telling Klein that unless a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer industry\n",
      "Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's concerns\n",
      "But he said time was running short and the strongest evidence in hand involved Microsoft's battle against Netscape Communications Corp\n",
      "in the market for the so-called browser software used for navigating the Internet\n",
      "``This is a Netscape case,'' the executive recalls Klein saying\n",
      "But five months later, the case that the government is bringing to trial on Monday extends well beyond Netscape and the browser war to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as ``a broad pattern of anti-competitive conduct'' by Microsoft\n",
      "Netscape, the government insists, is still a prime example of the pattern _ but only one of several examples\n",
      "The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence added to the case since May\n",
      "James Barksdale, Netscape's president and chief executive, will appear first, but he will be followed by executives representing a cross section of the nation's high-technology companies including Intel, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, America Online and Intuit\n",
      "In bringing a more ambitious, complicated case to trial than the one it filed in May, the government has chosen a high-risk strategy\n",
      "The law states that new evidence can be added to a suit after it is filed, but not new charges\n",
      "And so, in his federal courtroom in Washington, U.S.District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far afield from the original suit\n",
      "But if the government wins its broadened case, the court-ordered remedies would no doubt be far tougher on Microsoft\n",
      "In May, the government's suggested steps amounted to equal treatment for Netscape's browser and Microsoft's browser\n",
      "But the government recently asked that the judge hold a separate hearing on remedies, if it wins the case\n",
      "The remedies under consideration now include more basic changes in Microsoft's business practices _ perhaps even a breakup of the company _ intended to loosen Microsoft's grip on computing\n",
      "That would be precisely the kind of sweeping reform that Microsoft's foes would applaud\n",
      "``The government has doubled the bet and doubled the stakes,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school who is co-author of the book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft.'' Meanwhile, in the Microsoft camp, the government's strategy is dismissed as a desperate act _ taken after a court ruling in June that threatened to undermine the antitrust suit\n",
      "That ruling came in a separate case, involving the interpretation of the consent decree that Microsoft signed with the Justice Department in 1995\n",
      "In the June ruling, a federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product\n",
      "The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate products, bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market\n",
      "``With the appeals-court ruling in June, the government lost the heart of its case,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior official in the Justice Department, who is now a consultant to Microsoft\n",
      "``So it has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything it can find _ even evidence the Justice Department has had for years _ into the gun barrel and see what hits.'' The June appellate ruling did shake the prosecution team\n",
      "But mostly it strengthened the hand of those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the case be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation\n",
      "At the same time, they say, new evidence was coming in as the investigation moved ahead and prosecutors raced to meet the accelerated trial schedule approved by the court\n",
      "Speed was a priority from the outset, they say\n",
      "The Justice Department and the states filed their suit in May to move before Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, was introduced in June\n",
      "While not seeking to block the release of Windows 98, government lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as PC makers and computer users adopt this latest version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, which functions as the central nervous system for more than 90 percent of personal computers sold\n",
      "The key allegations, government lawyers note, have not changed since May _ namely, that Microsoft illegally used its market power in operating systems to defend its monopoly position and to try to extend into new markets\n",
      "``But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the May filing was the browser,'' said one person who worked on the case\n",
      "``The real game plan was always to get a broader case.'' What is more, one person noted, the prosecution team was not at full strength until shortly before the suit was filed\n",
      "David Boies, a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at Cravath, Swaine  Moore who successfully defended IBM in its 13-year confrontation with the government, was named as special counsel for the Justice Department last December\n",
      "But Boies, who left Cravath last year, did not start working full-time for the Justice Department until mid-April, because he was still finishing private cases for his own firm, Boies  Schiller\n",
      "The antitrust suit filed in May leaned heavily on the Netscape story, mentioning Microsoft's main rival in the browser market some 130 times in the complaint and a supporting memorandum\n",
      "But it also prominently mentioned Microsoft's tactics against Sun Microsystems, creator of Java, an Internet programming language, and cited it as an ``example'' of Microsoft's behavior\n",
      "``It was crafted as a template that could be added to without much stretching,'' one person involved in the case said\n",
      "And so, as new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern, Klein step by step approved the widening of the case, the person said\n",
      "And that explains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that has been in the hands of the Justice Department for years has been added to the case since May; only after gathering new evidence did it become apparent that the older material fit the pattern of the current case\n",
      "For example, the government has added the contention that Microsoft pressured Intel Corp., the big microchip maker and a close partner of Microsoft, to curb its development efforts in multimedia and Internet software because they might conflict with Microsoft's plans\n",
      "The government contends that the arm-twisting occurred at meetings between the two companies three years ago, especially one on Aug\n",
      "2, 1995, which was attended by Andrew Grove, the Intel chairman, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman\n",
      "Part of the government's evidence in the Intel-Microsoft episode is copies of the handwritten notes taken by Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president who attended the meetings, and a memo written by him on Aug\n",
      "28, 1995\n",
      "The memo, still under court seal, said that Gates ``made vague threats'' and was ``livid'' about Intel's investments in the Internet ``and wanted them stopped.'' A handwritten note, also under court seal, quotes Paul Maritz, a Microsoft executive, as saying that Netscape is their ``common enemy'' and that Intel's role should be to ``fill in stuff in and around Microsoft's strategy.'' These documents were sent by Intel to the Justice Department's office in San Francisco in November 1995, in response to a Civil Investigative Demand _ a civil subpoena _ served on Intel on Nov\n",
      "10, 1995\n",
      "On its own, the Intel material was intriguing, but it became part of the antitrust suit only as other evidence surfaced, one person close to the case said\n",
      "The government is contending that Microsoft also tried to urge Apple to stop selling its Quicktime multimedia software in the Windows market and tried to convince Real Networks Inc\n",
      "to pull back in the market for so-called streaming software\n",
      "The government case has also broadened, people involved in the case say, as more witnesses from the industry have been increasingly willing to testify\n",
      "``In the beginning, most people in the industry believed that the government would lose and Microsoft would retaliate if they came forward,'' one person said\n",
      "``But as the strength of our case was perceived to improve, more people were willing to come forward, and things snowballed\n",
      "You get Intel, it's easier to get Apple and so on.'' \n",
      "Microsoft Corp\n",
      "has said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week\n",
      "But judging from an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments in the book as well\n",
      "To cite one example, Microsoft contends that its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are a single integrated product\n",
      "In its suit, the government asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web\n",
      "In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A\n",
      "Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David B\n",
      "Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft executive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's browser was it integrated with Windows\n",
      "Microsoft hurried its first browser offerings into the market, the book says, in its race to catch up with Netscape, then took a more ambitious approach with Internet Explorer 3.0, which was introduced in August 1996\n",
      "In that version it changed its software design to use programming modules, or components, that could be put together and rearragned like building blocks\n",
      "In the book, Ben Slivka, a Microsoft general manager, is quoted as saying, ``IE 3.0 was the key thing because we did the componentized browser,'' He added, ``We really made Internet Explorer part of the Windows platform.'' The timing could be legally significant because in its suit the government cites as evidence requests before August 1996 by personal computer makers that wanted to load Netscape's browser on their machines instead of Microsoft's browser\n",
      "Microsoft denied the requests, insisting its browers and Windows were a single, integrated product\n",
      "Microsoft's legal team obtained an early manuscript of the new book last month, by issuing a subpoena to a Netscape executive who was given a confidential copy by the authors to review\n",
      "Microsoft has also sought the transcripts of 44 current and former Netscape employees interviewed by the authors\n",
      "A federal judge in Boston last week denied Microsoft access to that research materials, but the company may appeal the ruling\n",
      "The new book, published by the Free Press imprint of Simon  Schuster, is being hurried into print so it can be shipped within days of the start of the Microsoft trial on Oct\n",
      "19\n",
      "But already, a few quotes from Netscape executives have leaked out\n",
      "The authors decided to send the complete manuscript to The New York Times and three other news organizations Monday, so that the material could be read in context\n",
      "Microsoft intends to use material from the book as evidence that Netscape's troubles resulted largely from its own missteps rather than from any alleged predatory practices by Microsoft\n",
      "The book does detail where Netscape stumbled, shifting its strategy too often and running into obstacles in its software development efforts\n",
      "In private antitrust suits, the argument that the competitor was his own worst enemy is an established defense\n",
      "But legal experts say that defense may well be far less effective in a federal case in which the government is seeking court-mandated changes in Microsoft's business practices rather than the monetary damages that are the goal of plaintiffs in private cases\n",
      "``It seems to me that this debate over Netscape's mistakes is a total sideshow,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, who is now at the Brookings Institution\n",
      "``But Microsoft has a big legal team, and it seems they are working on every defense they can find.'' The book quotes a former Netscape executive, Ram Shriram, as saying the company bungled a chance to win a sizable share of the browser business from America Online Inc\n",
      "But that was a second-chance to do a deal with America Online, the leading online service\n",
      "The government's case focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose Internet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main Windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing\n",
      "For a book entitled ``Competing on Internet Time,'' it is intriguing that one of its central themes is that Netcape got too wedded to the notion that the Internet revolution would change everything quickly\n",
      "Microsoft, by contrast, stuck to its three-year planning horizon that enabled the company, the authors write, to ``mesh its short-run tactical plans with a broader strategic view of how to win the war.'' The book quotes Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, as saying, ``The fact of the matter is that customers can't take cataclysmic change every three months\n",
      "The organization also can't\n",

      "_ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief, vague and malleable\n",
      "The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts\n",
      "Sponsored by Sen\n",
      "John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads\n",
      "Farmers, laborers and small-business owners _ sizable voting groups _ resented the trusts as vehicles of concentrated power\n",
      "But the trusts, large national holding corporations, were viewed by many others as engines of modernization and industrialization\n",
      "Economists at the time opposed the Sherman Act, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise\n",
      "No one knew what impact it would have, but one senator, quoted in Matthew Josephson's ``The Robber Barons,'' explained that nearly everyone agreed that ``something must be flung out to appease the restive masses.'' The act's two key provisions, Sections 1 and 2, mention ``conspiracy,'' ``restraint of trade'' and ``attempt to monopolize.'' Yet while the Sherman Act is now interpreted as the Magna Carta of competition, it never uses the term\n",
      "After it was passed, critics of the trusts derided the ``impenetrable'' language of the Sherman Act and called it the Swiss Cheese Act\n",
      "But by the early 1900s, the political climate had changed\n",
      "The growing antagonism for the trusts, especially as income gaps widened, was tapped by an avowed trustbuster, Theodore Roosevelt, who became president in 1901\n",
      "``The Sherman Act has always been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived exploitation and the aggregation of power,'' said Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School\n",
      "The model trust _ and the principal target of the trustbusters _ was Standard Oil\n",
      "Shrewdly, Roosevelt made a distinction between good trusts, which thrived because of their superior efficiency, and bad trusts, which grew not as the result of inevitable economic forces but because of unfair business practices\n",
      "Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained about the company and the business practices of its founder, John D\n",
      "Rockefeller\n",
      "But during those years, the price of kerosene _ burned to light the nation's homes _declined steadily\n",
      "So Standard Oil, it could could reasonably be argued, was an ``enterprising monopoly.'' In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face genuine competition\n",
      "When consumers were hurt by the Standard Oil monopoly, popular support for antitrust action against the company swelled, encouraged by Roosevelt and his successor, William Howard Taft\n",
      "The federal suit against Standard Oil was filed in 1906, and the Supreme Court approved the breakup of the company in 1911\n",
      "Standard Oil and the Microsoft case, historians observe, have some common themes\n",
      "Both were dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller\n",
      "``But there is no presidential involvement and there is no real consumer dissatisfaction in the Microsoft case,'' said Ron Chernow, author of ``Titan,'' a best-selling biography of Rockefeller\n",
      "``And Rockefeller,'' Chernow added, ``never went through the kind of honeymoon period of widespread public adulation and favorable press coverage as Bill Gates has had.'' \n",
      "Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, as passed by Congress in 1890\n",
      "As the foundation on which federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted of violating it\n",

      "Nor, by all accounts, of politics\n",
      "Instead, like the software industry itself, the government's pursuit of Microsoft has taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started in 1989\n",
      "It was in November of that year, on a hot afternoon at a computer-industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd been dragged to the news conference with a senior executive from IBM _ which at the time dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry\n",
      "The two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal computers and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software _ were collaborating on the design and marketing of a new operating system called OS/2\n",
      "But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a competing product, Windows\n",
      "The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which system was going to become the new standard? With Gates standing uncomfortably at his side, James Cannavino, an IBM divisional president, said that the two companies wanted to ``clear the air.'' OS/2 was the future, he said\n",
      "As for Windows, he added, it would remain a niche product for under-equipped computers\n",

      "But a few weeks later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles, in Byte magazine\n",
      "``IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified vision of graphical operating environments,'' the article said, ``and it looks sort of like a U.S\n",
      "economic model,'' divided into lower-, middle- and upper-class products\n",

      "Microsoft, today the most feared company in the software business and carrying a stock-market value of nearly $234 billion, presents a huge and highly visible antitrust target\n",
      "Yet, while the company's allies ask, ``What is the Clinton administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?'' the answer seems to be there is none\n",
      "In interviews, more than a dozen current and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of the government or of Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations\n",
      "As for politics, all the officials agreed that the antitrust division operates independent of the administration's political considerations\n",
      "Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division during the Bush administration, and he is now a Washington lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for Microsoft\n",
      "``When I was there,'' Rule said of his Justice days, ``the White House was punctilious in terms of never getting involved in whatever we decided to do\n",
      "There was no communication between antitrust and other branches of government.'' Asked if he believed that policy had changed under the Clinton administration, he said: ``Not really\n",
      "I've seen nothing to suggest it.'' Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and in an interview dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case, he said: ``There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical matter, civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out without any political contact.'' Klein said, by way of examples, that he might discuss merger cases involving military or aviation industries with the Defense Department or Transportation Department\n",
      "``But never the White House,'' he said\n",
      "``For a significant case, we might call the White House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press conference.' '' ``The last time there was any interference,'' he added, ``was the Dita Beard-ITT case.'' Mrs\n",
      "Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp., was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000 donation to the Republican National Convention had ``gone a long way'' toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company by the Nixon administration's Justice Department\n",
      "The authenticity of the memo was never proved, and Mrs\n",
      "Beard always denied writing it\n",
      "In any case, Klein says, ``since Watergate, it's been immaculate.'' In the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment\n",
      "In answer to a question during a news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Clinton said: ``I have taken the view that I should not comment on matters within the Justice Department\n",
      "At this time, I do not think I should depart from that policy on this case, even though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector of our economy\n",
      "But I have to say, based on what I know to date, I have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the Justice Department has handled the matter.'' Since then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case, publicly at least\n",
      "And Gore, who generally represents the administration on technology issues, has never commented at all\n",
      "In Rule's opinion, the administration would be foolish to involve itself, even if it were politically acceptable to do so\n",
      "``It would be a little odd for the administration to push the Justice Department in this suit,'' he said\n",
      "``It would be a policy mistake and a political mistake\n",
      "I would be hard pressed to explain why they would do that.'' Taking sides in the highly charged technology world is dangerous, particularly since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley companies for political donations and support\n",
      "In fact, the present and former government officials all said the suit was simply a natural extension of the inquiries conducted during the last nine years\n",
      "They began at the FTC\n",
      "Soon after Washington read that article in Byte, the FTC staff opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2 question\n",
      "But as has happened so often in the following years, turns in the market made the initial inquiry irrelevant\n",
      "Microsoft abandoned its agreement with IBM, and Windows quickly grew to be the industry standard, while OS/2 remained a cipher\n",
      "But as that issue faded, once government investigators began looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them\n",
      "In 1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed Microsoft that the investigation was being expanded\n",
      "The agency, his letter said, was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was using its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle competition in other areas\n",
      "That general idea lies at the heart of the present suit\n",
      "One former senior FTC official said the commission staff had confidence in the case but realized that the Reagan-era commissioners, who had to approve any suit, might have a different view\n",
      "``We knew the commission might have difficulty with a monopolization case,'' the former official said\n",
      "``They hadn't brought a case in years.'' And in fact, in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of whether to file formal charges\n",
      "The deadlock served as a dismissal\n",
      "Then, a few months later, the Justice Department decided to pick up the case\n",
      "``It was farther along than most cases we got,'' recalled Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution\n",
      "``Usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few documents,'' he said\n",
      "``But this was a fully researched record\n",
      "They gave us the files and briefed us on what they had done.'' The Justice Department lawyers picked up the same thread\n",
      "``The general idea behind our inquiry,'' Litan said, ``was that they should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating systems to cement a monopoly in other areas.'' In 1995, Microsoft and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed\n",
      "The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another\n",
      "The charges in the present suit are similar in many ways\n",
      "Even with the agreement, the government investigations continued\n",
      "That same year, Justice Department investigators showed up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp\n",
      "for the first time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry\n",
      "``America Online had been complaining,'' a senior Netscape executive recalled, ``because Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network,'' a competing online service, ``with Windows.'' Once more, market forces overtook the investigation\n",
      "The Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America Online prospered and grew\n",
      "But, not surprisingly, new complaints filled the void\n",
      "In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney general who headed the antitrust division, remarked: ``We get complaints about Microsoft all the time\n",
      "We have become a kind of Microsoft complaints center\n",
      "And we take them very seriously.'' In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived\n",
      "In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed by Netscape\n",
      "The next year the Justice Department formally charged Microsoft with violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows to installation of the company's Web browser on new computers\n",
      "``It seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,'' a natural extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the department by then\n",
      "A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court panel overturned that ruling this summer\n",
      "In the meantime, last May the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday\n",
      "It contends that Microsoft has engaged in bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations of the last nine years\n",
      "``A good part of this case is just Round II of the case we dealt with in Round I,'' in the early in the 1990s, Litan said\n",
      "Or, as the former senior FTC official put it, ``there's certainly a common thread that runs all the way through here.'' But through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled and spun by hundreds of different hands\n",

      "The case of United States vs\n",
      "Microsoft Corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments\n",
      "Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin Monday in U.S\n",
      "District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines\n",
      "The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today\n",
      "The government says its objective is to curb illegal monopolistic business practices that threaten to render large parts of the economy vulnerable to the vicissitudes of a single company\n",
      "Microsoft asserts that the case is intended to give the government control over which features can be added to Windows\n",
      "However grand the economic stakes, the legal dispute is narrow\n",
      "The government says that Microsoft's contracts with computer manufacturers and with companies that provide access to the Internet illegally stifle competition\n",
      "The contracts prohibit manufacturers from substituting Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser for Microsoft's Internet Explorer\n",
      "They also prohibit them from removing from the Windows main screen, or desktop, links to sites on the World Wide Web run by Microsoft or its partners\n",
      "Microsoft's contracts with companies that connect people to the Internet and with businesses that sell goods and services on the Web require favored treatment for Internet Explorer over Navigator in exchange for links on the Windows desktop\n",
      "In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate them at will\n",
      "Microsoft says that its contracts are legal because they produce tangible benefits for customers, including easier Internet access\n",
      "The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another\n",
      "The contracts with manufacturers and Internet services are illegal, the government says, because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect Microsoft's existing monopoly in operating systems\n",
      "The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department\n",
      "Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software platform on which other programs run\n",
      "So contracts intended to drive browsers out of the market would also insulate the Windows monopoly\n",
      "Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary\n",
      "Professor Lawrence White of New York University, who was chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division in the early 1980s, says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous\n",
      "No one, he said, ``would challenge the right of manufacturers to tie erasers to the tip of pencils, tires to an automobile or buttons to shirts.'' His point, shared widely among economists, is that some tying benefits consumers if, for example, it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs\n",
      "But tying can be bad if it locks in monopoly power\n",
      "The courts, White says, have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad, which is the nub of the legal dispute\n",
      "Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers\n",
      "The Justice Department says that Microsoft's practices must clear a higher hurdle: yielding ``net'' consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long-term harm to competition\n",
      "So which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws? The simple answer is that no one knows for sure, which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment\n",
      "Consider a 1985 case, Aspen Skiing Co\n",
      "vs\n",
      "Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., and a 1951 case, Lorain Journal Co\n",

      "In the first, Aspen Skiing, the owner of three major ski runs in Aspen, Colo\n",

      "When Aspen Skiing unilaterally canceled the agreement, its rival's revenues shriveled and the rival sued\n",
      "The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers\n",
      "In the Lorain Journal case, the only local newspaper in Lorain, Ohio, refused to sell advertising to companies that advertised on a new radio station\n",
      "Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers\n",
      "Indeed, in Aspen Skiing, the court even forced the monopolist to do business with its rival, a precedent that augurs well for the Justice Department, which seeks to force Microsoft to install Netscape's browser alongside its own\n",
      "But Charles Rule, a legal consultant to Microsoft, says that in both cases the courts threw out exclusionary practices only because they offered no consumer benefit\n",
      "The courts, he argues, never pounced on practices that resulted in lower prices or better products or service\n",
      "Nor did the courts in either case call for balancing immediate benefits against hypothetical long-term harm\n",
      "Rule argues that Microsoft's practices produce demonstrable consumer benefits\n",
      "Besides, he says, unlike the actions taken by The Lorain Journal or Aspen Skiing, Microsoft's contracts do not prevent consumers from installing Netscape's browser or from using the Web sites of Microsoft's rivals\n",

      "Yet, the court said, a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately\n",
      "That principle could undercut Microsoft's defense that the functional interdependence of Windows and Explorer requires bundling\n",
      "But Microsoft will point to a strong concurring opinion that called for a tougher standard for the government to meet when it alleges tying\n",
      "Microsoft will also draw support from several court rulings that allowed IBM to change the design of its computers in ways that made it hard for vendors to attach peripheral equipment\n",
      "But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing test\n",
      "The courts, Microsoft will emphasize, steer clear of redesigning technically sophisticated products\n",
      "The Justice Department's rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers, so it makes no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar's worth of benefits today but, by stamping out competition, drive prices up by $1,000 tomorrow\n",
      "The Justice Department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers\n",
      "Experts agree that the courts will subject Microsoft's restrictive contracts with Internet companies to a balancing test\n",
      "But exactly how the court will decide whether consumers are helped or hurt is up for grabs\n",
      "A balancing test would have the courts weigh the immediate benefits to consumers of one-click access to Internet sites and of features of a bundled Windows-Explorer package versus the harm over time of diminished competition in the markets for browsers and operating systems\n",

      "``The practical effect of balancing is to hand defendants like Microsoft almost certain victory.'' Microsoft argues _ and many antitrust experts agree _ that the courts have in fact gravitated away from a balancing test toward a simpler ``predation'' test for exclusionary contracts\n",
      "Under this standard, a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later\n",
      "Microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation, which amounts to victimizing its customers, than it would defending itself against a charge that its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good\n",
      "The antitrust record, says William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division under President Reagan, is littered with ``contradictory, ambiguous and sometimes nonsensical'' verdicts\n",

Holbrooke's mission to Milosevic was described by the American diplomats as ``not a do or die trip,'' but they added, ``We're at a very serious juncture.'' Shortly after Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader issued a defiant statement on Serbian television in which he said the ``threats of aggression'' outlined by Holbrooke represented ``a criminal act.'' Milosevic, who rarely comments about his meetings with foreign diplomats and whose tough words cast an unusually ominous tone, also said that Holbrooke's position constituted ``support for Albanian terrorists and not the Albanian people.''

      "``It was not quite an ultimatum,'' the diplomat said, ``but more a matter of what steps have to be taken to show compliance.'' The essence of Holbrooke's demands centered on issues outlined in a United Nations Security Council resolution of two weeks ago\n",

      "There has been sporadic shooting, the monitors have reported\n",
      "But this superficial calm is not good enough because the Serb military has the capacity to resume fighting very quickly, a NATO military officer said Monday\n",

The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence around villages so that refugees who have fled have the confidence to return, the military officer said\n",
      "Some interior ministry police officers had left the province, but not enough, he added\n",
      "On the question of how badly damaged the KLA had been by the Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, the NATO officer said, ``It's a fair assessment that the KLA is dismantled but not destroyed.''

      "Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats say\n",
      "Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace in Bosnia, acted as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention\n",
      "Russia stepped up its warnings against such action and dispatched its foreign and defense ministers on an unusually high-level mission to see the Yugoslav president Sunday in Belgrade\n",
      "As he has so often, Milosevic appears to have bowed to foreign demands in the nick of time and yet still accomplished what he wanted\n",
      "This weekend, foreign diplomatic observers in Kosovo reported that a ``military stand-down'' had taken place in the province, where Milosevic's forces have waged a fierce offensive against Albanian rebels\n",
      "The observers said that except for segments of three brigades, most units of the Yugoslav army were ``home.'' The daily reports of the observer mission, made up of U.S., European Union and Russian military experts, are one of the key elements in helping Washington and European capitals decide whether Milosevic has met their demands for a cease-fire\n",
      "By putting the army back in its barracks, sending some police units out of Kosovo and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages, Milosevic may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here and in Washington said\n",
      "But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO looked the other way, he enjoyed a three-month license to overwhelm the Kosovo Liberation Army _ the rebel army fighting for independence for Kosovo and its ethnic Albanian majority _ and terrorize the rural civilian population that supports it\n",
      "His military operation created more than 250,000 refugees, whom the Clinton administration is gearing up to take care of this winter through a variety of relief organizations\n",
      "U.S\n",
      "officials said they expected Richard Holbrooke, the U.S\n",
      "envoy who dealt with Milosevic in negotiating an end to the war in Bosnia, to meet with him on Monday to discuss a political plan for Kosovo\n",
      "The heart of the disagreement in Kosovo is between Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal republic, which insists on keeping Kosovo as a province, and the ethnic Albanians there who have chafed under Milosevic's repression since he stripped the province of virtual autonomy in 1989, and who now seek independence\n",
      "The West, fearing the precedent that independence for Kosovo would set in other conflicts in the world, has been trying to mediate a middle course\n",
      "In essence, diplomats said they believed that the plan Holbrooke will present to Milosevic calls for a three-year interim period leading to a status fairly close to the pre-1989 autonomy arrangement\n",
      "Since the Kosovo conflict flared up in March, critics of Washington's policy toward Milosevic argue that he has been able to choreograph every move to suit his goal: pushing the Albanian population into submission with impunity\n",
      "``The United States and its allies have waited four months while he cleaned the clock of the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' said Morton Abramowitz, head of the International Crisis Group, a policy analysis organization, ``and taken three weeks to discuss military action, with the result that 500 Albanian villages were destroyed.'' Administration officials now acknowledge that when NATO failed to live up to its earlier threat in June to strike Serbia, Milosevic took advantage of the indecision and plunged ahead with an artillery and tank offensive against the lightly armed guerrilla forces, whose bedrock of popular support had helped win them effective control of large swaths of Kosovo territory, including key roads\n",
      "While he was doing that, Milosevic skillfully managed a key requirement for Washington: he made sure that the war did not spill over into neighboring Albania and Macedonia, fragile countries in a traditionally volatile area\n",
      "All along, the biggest fear in Washington has been that the Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause\n",
      "Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just three years after peace was secured in Bosnia\n",
      "Milosevic catered to Washington's concern that the conflict be contained\n",
      "The Yugoslav army mined Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania, ensuring that few refugees could escape and limiting routes for arms supplies for the rebels\n",
      "The Yugoslav leader also understood that Washington was unsure about how to deal with the disorganized Albanian political leadership in Kosovo and the unbending Kosovo Liberation Army, whose main chiefs were hardened emigres returned from Switzerland and Germany\n",
      "For example, Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to meet in May with Ibrahim Rugova, the top Albanian political leader in Kosovo, an encounter that turned out to be little more than a photo opportunity\n",
      "For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month before\n",
      "After meeting with Rugova, Milosevic stepped up his military operations in Kosovo, forcing Washington to reverse itself again and carry out the investment ban\n",
      "In late June, Holbrooke met with two self-styled Kosovo guerrilla commanders in the province's western town of Junik but then broke off all contact\n",
      "Clinton administration officials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would bolster the separatist forces\n",
      "To try to put the best face on the situation, Washington worked with Moscow to get Milosevic to accept the presence of international monitors who would patrol Kosovo and report on military action\n",
      "The monitors were slow in getting organized\n",
      "By August, when the Yugoslav army, backed by the Serbian special police, were in full swing against the rebels and burning and looting villages in the process, the monitors found it difficult to gain access to the fighting\n",
      "They drove up to roadblocks, knew something was going on from the sounds and the smoke, but could not be precise\n",
      "In recent days as the tanks and artillery have withdrawn, access has improved, the monitors say\n",
      "But there are some areas in central Kosovo around Likovac and Gornje Obrinje that the monitors have ruled off limits because of land mines on the roads\n",
      "The mines are believed to have been planted by the guerrillas\n",
      "Gornje Obrinje was the site of a massacre of 18 ethnic Albanian women, children and elderly people on Sept\n",
      "26\n",
      "A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on Sunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon\n",
      "The Yugoslav army and police forces have been responsible for the vast majority of atrocities in the Kosovo conflict, said a report by New York-based group Human Rights Watch, released here on Sunday\n",
      "The report said the rebels had also violated the laws of war by taking civilian hostages and carrying out summary executions\n",
      "But the violations by the guerrillas were on a ``lesser scale'' than the government abuses, the author of the report, Fred Abrahams, concluded\n",
      "The report focused on what it called a watershed in the conflict _ the attack by police forces on three ethnic Albanian villages in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo\n",
      "At least 83 people, including 24 women and children, were killed in the attack, which involved helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriers\n",
      "In the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, which is a four-hour drive north through rolling countryside from Kosovo's capital of Pristina, Milosevic remains politically secure\n",
      "That is in part, his domestic critics say, because diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature\n",

      "In a letter to the United Nations Security Council released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials to grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.'' ``The intentional and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal is an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations,'' she said\n",
      "The Texas judge fired off the letter last Friday following the refusal of Belgrade authorities to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo\n",
      "McDonald asked the Security Council to impose ``measures which are sufficiently compelling to bring the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the fold of law-abiding nations.''

      "Piecing together what happened, from surviving family members, ethnic Albanian separatist forces and official Serbian information, a story emerges of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tanks, artillery and infantry\n",
      "The Serbian forces fighting here appear to have suffered unusually heavy losses and, after the guerrillas finally fled, took revenge against the civilians, shooting women and children at close range as they tried to run away from their pursuers\n",

      "``First it was machine guns, then grenades, then cannon,'' she said\n",
      "``Every time I moved and they heard leaves rustling, they shot.'' The massacre of the Delijajs, whose forebears settled in the Drenica Valley about 150 years ago, was not the first in the conflict that ravaged the Serbian province between March and October and has now lulled into an uneasy truce\n",
      "Indeed, the conflict between Serbian forces bent on keeping Kosovo in Serbia and guerrillas fighting for the independence of its heavily ethnic Albanian population first drew international attention with the massacre of the Jasari clan in early March by Serbian units at Prekaz, in central Kosovo\n",

      "By then, the Albanian guerrillas had fled the area around the Delijaj compound, dispersing after what a senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Naim Maloku, termed particularly fierce combat with the Serbs\n",
      "In the days before Sept\n",
      "26, he said, the guerrillas _ caught in a Serbian pincer movement _ had decided to fight rather than surrender\n",
      "The fighting _ sometimes house to house, even room to room _ took an unusually heavy toll among the Serbs, said Maloku, a former officer in the Yugoslav army\n",
      "He said he believed that it was those deaths the Serbs avenged with the massacre of the Delijajs\n",
      "In other major attacks during the conflict, the guerrillas generally found an escape hatch\n",
      "In Obrinje, led by another former officer of the Yugoslav army whom Maloku declined to name, the guerrillas fought, using land mines and rocket-propelled grenades\n",
      "Maloku said he knew from a report made by rebel headquarters that at least 47 Serbian soldiers and police officers were killed in the fighting between here and Bajince, three miles east\n",
      "``We took weapons from 47 Serbs,'' he said\n",
      "The state-controlled Serbian media center in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said 10 Serbian police officers were killed in the fighting, including five reservists who died when their vehicle hit an antitank mine on Sept\n",
      "25\n",
      "The announcement of 10 Serbs killed in one action is unusually high\n",

      "From 1991 to 1995, in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, Serbs, Croats and, to a far lesser extent, the main victims, the Muslims, avenged World War II massacres and new blood feuds, driven into killing by leaders who exploited old conflicts to carve new fiefs for themselves as the old, Communist Yugoslavia collapsed\n",
      "In this case, it appears, Serbian vengeance was visited upon the Delijajs\n",
      "Survivors of the clan said they had feared an assault on their collection of mud and brick homes lining a rocky dirt track directly opposite the village of Likovac, the Serbs' base just a mile away\n",
      "The Serbs had pushed the rebels out of Likovac in August and the guerrillas had established new headquarters around Bajince, six miles east of Obrinje\n",
      "As the Serbs swept down from the nearby Cicavica Mountains, and up from the road that runs from Pristina to Klina, it was clear that Obrinje would be a target\n",
      "Most women and children in the area had moved into Apple Valley, where more than 10,000 refugees had gathered outdoors, seeking safety in numbers\n",
      "But Imer Delijaj, 38, said he decided that the ravine below his family compound would be a better hiding place\n",
      "He said he believed the women, children and elderly would be spared if the Serbs found them\n",
      "As the Serbs approached on foot the Saturday morning of the massacre, the last person to flee the compound itself was Bashkim Delijaj, 21, the youngest son of 94-year-old Fazli\n",
      "Bashkim Delijaj said he had stayed behind to look after his bedridden father\n",
      "``The shelling started again at 7 a.m\n",
      "on Saturday and I saw a tank convoy approaching, with infantry behind the tanks,'' Bashkim Delijaj recalled in an interview\n",
      "``I was smoking a cigarette when a grenade fell on the roof and from a hole in the gate I saw soldiers coming from about 30 meters away\n",
      "They were in brown army uniforms, had huge knives or small axes\n",
      "Many had beards.'' Bashkim Delijaj said he was unable to carry his father to safety, and did not have the courage to tell him what was happening\n",
      "``I told him I was getting the animals out of the barn,'' he said\n",
      "He said he ran, hid, ran some more, and eventually received shelter from a farmer, all the time hearing shooting and shelling\n",
      "When the firing had died down Monday morning, he returned to the compound and ran into Imer, still wearing his guerrilla uniform\n",
      "They went to one of the houses and found Imer Delijaj's brother, Adem, 33, shot dead, his body sprawled on the ground in the rain, and the burned torso of Fazli\n",
      "``I looked in the window of our house and saw only the bones of my father, which looked like what we learned in biology class,'' he said\n",
      "Together, the two men went to find out what had happened in the ravine\n",
      "There they found the bodies\n",
      "First, Ali, 65, who, Imer Delijaj said, had been cut through the neck with his own tobacco cutting knife\n",
      "Then Pajazit, who had been decapitated in a makeshift tent, his brain placed between two foam mattresses\n",
      "Then Hava, 65, who was sprawled near the tent\n",

      "Imer's sister-in-law, Luljeta, who was seven months pregnant, had been mutilated, he said\n",
      "A little further up the ravine, Imer said he saw his wife, Lumnije, 30\n",
      "He opened his wife's coat and found his 6-week-old baby girl, now 3 months old and recovering at a relative's home in Likovac\n",
      "He said he tried to clean the baby and then put her under his jacket and walked a few feet further to find the bodies of his 4-year-old daughter, Menduhije, and two other young children, Donieta, 5, and Gentiana, 7\n",
      "The corpses of other family members were found in the woods and two older men, Habib, 51, and Hysen, 53, were found the next morning, Imer said\n",
      "On Oct\n",
      "3, the bodies of two missing teen-age girls, Mehane, 16, and Antigua, 13, were found in the bushes at the side of a road near an abandoned Serbian police compound\n",

      "Human Rights Watch, which has been documenting the Delijaj massacre, has described it as the most vicious of a pattern of attacks on civilians by the Serbs in the Kosovo conflict\n",
      "(To a lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians, forcing them from their homes, and allegedly carried out at least two massacres.) The evidence strongly indicates that the Gornje Obrinje killings were followed by conscious mutilations carried out after the victims were killed, a coming report by Human Rights Watch says\n",
      "Delijaj family members have told Human Rights Watch monitors and others that they saw an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying the Serbian police officers during the fighting\n",
      "They believe that the police officer, who is posted at the nearby Glogovac police station, was used by the Serbian special police officers as a guide to the Obrinje area\n",
      "This police officer, who is apparently one of a small group of ethnic Albanians officers who have remained loyal to the Serbs, could be an important witness for criminal investigators from the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to human rights experts\n",
      "``The ethnic Albanian policeman could be an important witness to identifying the police and army units responsible for the atrocities,'' said Peter Boueckhart, a researcher for Human Rights Watch\n",
      "``It is vital that those who carried out these atrocities are prosecuted by the Hague tribunal.'' At the burned Delijaj compound in the last week, Imer Delijaj has been acting as the host of a wake which, following Albanian tradition, will last several weeks and began after family members returned from their hiding places in the woods\n",
      "Color photographs of the youngest members of the family, and of Imer's mother and grandmother, have been mounted behind glass on a table outside the gate\n",
      "A 30-year-old faded black and white picture of Fazli in a double-breasted suit stands apart, a sign of ultimate respect\n",
      "An outsized Albanian flag with a black double-headed eagle on a red field is draped behind the table\n",
      "Imer Delijaj's face seemed tense and his words were spare as he described his family's death\n",
      "He did not express direct remorse for allowing his family to use a hiding place so close to the family compound, which for all practical purposes was an informal base for fighters\n",
      "His lawyer, Bajram Krasniqi, who said he was eager to be helpful to investigators of the Hague tribunal, said in Pristina that he believed Imer Delijaj felt guilty for a faulty decision\n",
      "Whether the tribunal will closely examine the case remains unclear\n",
      "Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, has issued only a handful of visas to investigators from the tribunal\n",
      "Two investigators who were in Kosovo at the time of the massacre left six days later without visiting the site or contacting Krasniqi about the killings\n",
      "Would Imer Delijaj seek revenge? As he sat on the floor of his living room with a group of male visitors, he replied: ``It's easy to answer\n",

      "He is indicted both in connection with ``direct personal involvement in the commission of these crimes'' as well as his command responsibility\n",
      "He is also accused of murder and other crimes against humanity\n",
      "Krstic was a colonel in 1995, and the deputy commander of the Drina battalion, but was promoted to general within days of the fall of Srebrenica\n",
      "He is considered a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen\n",
      "Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, both of whom are wanted by the tribunal\n",

      "Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, called Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and said she was delighted with the arrest\n",
      "The general was only indicted on Oct\n",
      "30, tribunal officials said, but the indictment was kept secret so there would be a better chance of a successful arrest\n",
      "NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana warned that other war crimes suspects still at large ``should realize that they, too, will be brought to justice.'' James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that the arrest ``serves as a standing warning to those indicted for war crimes, who remain at large, that they will be held individually accountable for their actions.'' The Bosnian Serbs reacted angrily to the arrest, with the hardline Bosnian Serb president, Nikola Poplasen, saying that his government would now reduce contacts with NATO-led peacekeeping forces ``to the necessary minimum.'' Poplasen, who defeated a more moderate candidate backed by Washington in September elections, said the arrest of Krstic had ``embittered and upset'' the Bosnian Serbs and would harm the implementation of the Dayton agreement that ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian war\n",
      "He said he would protest the arrest, and his remarks were later endorsed by parliament in a majority vote\n",
      "A senior official of a NATO country called the arrest ``very good news'' and said it was ``a warning to Milosevic himself'' and others who have not been publicly indicted that ``the murders committed have not been forgotten.'' A Pentagon official said the arrest, the most important made in the American sector, ``was a sign that this is a continuing process.'' NATO-led peacekeeping troops have now arrested nine people wanted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, four of whom were the subject of sealed indictments\n",
      "There have been numerous calls for the arrest of Mladic and Karadzic, the two most infamous men indicted, but they normally are accompanied by armed guards\n",
      "NATO forces have never tried to arrest them, apparently fearing casualties and an angry public reaction from Bosnian Serbs\n",

      "He is the commander of the Bosnian Serb 5th Corps and was arrested while traveling on the road to Bijelina\n",
      "At the outset of the war in 1992, he was an officer of the Yugoslav Army, and like all senior Bosnian Serb officers, was transferred to the new Bosnian Serb force\n",
      "In 1994, he lost a leg in a mine explosion\n",
      "One Bosnian Serb official said in a telephone interview that, at the time, Krstic had responsibility for ``anti-terrorist units'' who were given some of the most difficult tasks\n",
      "``Srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people don't talk about it,'' the official said\n",
      "``But everyone believes it was the anti-terrorist units that were sent to do the killing.'' In Banja Luka on Wednesday, some members of the Bosnian Serb parliament protested the arrest, saying that Krstic was simply doing his job as a soldier\n",

      "But in July 1995, the United Nations did not protect Srebrenica with air strikes, and peacekeeping troops watched as the Serbs marched in, separated Muslim men and women and marched the men off\n",
      "``Srebrenica signaled the massive failure of the West,'' said Daalder\n",

Xu's wife, He Xintong, said Wednesday night that she had still not been informed of the specific charge against her husband, although she surmised from the aggressive behavior of the arresting officers that the sentence ``could be long.'' Qin's family was told that he was charged with ``plotting to subvert the government,'' a crime that for serious offenses commands sentences of three years to life\n",
      "In the Chinese criminal code, this charge comes under a grab-bag section called ``threatening state security,'' which makes almost any political activity that questions or hampers the authority of the Communist Party illegal, from ``violent or nonviolent activities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities,'' to ``activities designed to change the basic nature of the state.'' Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stems from their efforts to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network of pro-democracy activists in more than a dozen cities around China that was formed this year\n",
      "In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the government, submitting repeated applications even after local authorities had declared the concept of an opposition party illegal\n",

      "Martinez has blamed his paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much\n",
      "He has sometimes flailed at poor pitches during hitter's counts of 3-1 and 2-0, instead of working the count, and he has admitted that his previous failures in the post-season have caused him to pursue the obviously unattainable five-run homer\n",
      "Actually, Martinez has already made some alterations, and he has reached base 7 times in his last 10 plates appearances on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch and 4 walks\n",

      "Knoblauch rounded the bases, crossed home plate and thrust both arms into the air, yelling to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic weightlifter who had just successfully hoisted a half-ton\n",
      "He stomped around the dugout, his helmet on, teammates banging on him happily\n",
      "When Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed\n",
      "Wall left the game, and Mark Langston took over\n",
      "Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter advanced on a wild pitch, Bernie Williams was intentionally walked\n",
      "Chili Davis drew a walk\n",
      "Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez coming to the plate, with exactly one run batted in in his first 76 career at-bats in league championship and World Series games\n",
      "With the count two balls and two strikes, Langston threw a pitch near the outside corner that he thought should have been a strike\n",
      "Instead, Garcia called it a ball\n",
      "Langston glared, snapping at the return throw\n",
      "Langston and Martinez and everyone on the field now understood that with the bases loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston would have to throw what players refer to as a cookie _ a tasty pitch over the middle\n",
      "Martinez ate up this cookie\n",
      "The ball soared into the upper deck in right field, lifting three years of post-season misery off the back of the Yankees' first baseman, a grand slam\n",
      "The crowd called out Martinez from the dugout again\n",
      "Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped both arms, and later the crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap\n",
      "San Diego's lead was long gone\n",
      "The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over Brown in the second inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the second\n",
      "They loaded the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, the rookie left fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left fielders have been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right field line with two outs\n",
      "The fans along the foul line stood, some waving to push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball landed on the line, skipping off the wall as two runners scored\n",
      "The Yankees had the early edge, they had jumped on Brown, and they had their best pitcher on the mound\n",
      "San Diego's Chris Gomez led off the second inning with a blooper over shortstop, the ball falling in for a single\n",
      "Quilvio Veras flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn to the plate\n",
      "David Wells got ahead in the count, no balls and two strikes, with a change-up and a fastball, before trying to run a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs during the regular season\n",
      "Vaughn attacked the pitch: a line drive that landed in the second deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake\n",
      "Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound to re-think the strategy, perhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you must pitch Vaughn on the outer edge of the plate\n",
      "Posada returned to the plate, called for an outside fastball, Wells threw\n",
      "Vaughn's swing was short and quick, the ball making a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck golf ball, before carrying over the wall in right-center field\n",
      "Tie game\n",
      "Wells retired the first two batters in the fifth inning, before jamming Veras with an inside fastball\n",
      "Veras' bat snapped on contact, but it was enough to send a looper into short center field, a single\n",
      "Gwynn stepped in, having hit a single in his first two at-bats, and looked for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery\n",
      "With a runner on first, he likes to try to pull a ball through the right side of the infield\n",
      "Wells fired a fastball, Gwynn turned on the pitch and ripped it, a line drive that crashed off the facing of the upper deck in right field\n",
      "The Padres jumped from the dugout, celebrating, as Wells turned away, disgusted, asking for a new baseball\n",
      "He got one, delivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep into the left field stands\n",
      "Two pitches, two home runs, the first back-to-back home runs allowed by Wells since April 30\n",
      "San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium was silent\n",
      "It would not stay that way\n",
      "\n",
      "As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he wants to do it with a free mind\n",
      "Free of worrying about his extremely uncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that has made this post-season as perplexing as it has been pleasing\n",
      "But it is not easy to keep the mind uncluttered\n",
      "Williams does not know if he will sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season, because he wants to test free agency\n",
      "There is a good chance the Yankees will not offer him the most lavish contract, so Williams might be forced to decide between the fattest paycheck and a new situation in the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a familiar situation in the Bronx\n",
      "Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared his client with players in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season, so that price tag has surely escalated after Williams won the American League batting title with a .339 average while drilling 26 homers and knocking in 97 runs\n",
      "Williams was asked if he agreed with the theory that other teams will outbid the Yankees\n",
      "``I do not know,'' said Williams, who has been aloof during this post-season, but has declined to discuss why\n",
      "``And I'm thinking about this a little more than I would like to\n",
      "I would like to keep my focus on the series.'' It is not an issue Williams or the Yankees wants to study Saturday or in the coming days, because the team is four victories away from a championship\n",
      "Still, it is an issue that hovers over the Yankees as ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general manager Brian Cashman\n",
      "``It's a tough thing,'' Cashman said about balancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality of trying to re-sign Williams\n",
      "``You know the ugliness of the future is right in front of you.'' Although Williams has been adamant about not discussing the future, he relented slightly Friday\n",
      "When a reporter asked him what the reasons would be for staying with the Yankees, Williams' answer included an escape clause\n",
      "``Just the fact that I've been here my whole career,'' Williams said\n",
      "``That has a lot to do with it\n",
      "The relationships that I've come to know during the years, I think it would be very hard, but not impossible, to start from scratch somewhere else.'' Williams continued: ``But I think the reality of the game in this day and age is things happen\n",
      "You can't really write things in stone that they're going to happen\n",
      "People get traded\n",
      "People become free agents and go to other teams\n",
      "I have to make a decision really thinking about all the people I'm accountable for.'' When Williams was asked what better situation could a player have than being the center fielder for the Yankees, winning a batting crown and being in the World Series, the 30-year-old was stumped\n",
      "``Wow, that's pretty good right there,'' Williams said\n",
      "``It's funny you mention that, because I really haven't thought about any of that\n",
      "I think, at some point in the off season, I was going to sit down and think, wow, it wasn't a bad year at all.'' While Cashman would not discuss financial matters, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams as much as $12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous after a possible championship\n",
      "It is more likely that the Yanks would offer Williams in the $10 million-a-year range\n",
      "``I'd hate to have to speculate on something at this point,'' Cashman said\n",
      "``We'll give it our best effort to sign him at a level that we're comfortable with\n",
      "Hopefully, that will be enough\n",
      "Then we'll have a marriage\n",
      "If not, we'll have a divorce.'' While Williams has earned the right to become a free agent and pursue the contract he wants in the city he wants, he has interesting choices to make\n",
      "When a reporter asked Williams how he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less from the Yankees to remain in a city where he is popular, where he likes his teammates and manager, and where the team has been in the post-season for four straight years, he did not hesitate to answer\n",
      "``My response to that would be it's not the time right now to start thinking about that,'' Williams said\n",
      "``If I start thinking about that, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World Series.'' Williams then talked about how the Yankees are at the end of a remarkable season and how he did not want his situation to disrupt that\n",
      "But, with Williams' status uncertain, he was asked if the next four to seven games would be bittersweet, since he could be ending a 13-year association with the Yankees\n",
      "``I don't want to talk about that,'' Williams said\n",
      "``I'm going to have a lot of fun out there\n",
      "I'm going to go all out.'' Then Williams walked away from the interview\n",
      "\n",
      "Hours after Darryl Strawberry was released from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with his two young children, joked about eating a small amount of chicken and potatoes and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., instead of in a hospital\n",
      "``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, in a telephone interview\n",
      "``It's nice to be home with the kids and to just kick back\n",
      "That's all that I'm going to do\n",
      "This feels good.'' Strawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon on Oct\n",
      "3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 days before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif\n",
      "The 36-year old outfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound frame, said he does not have enough strength to attend any of the World Series games and is content watching his teammates play the Padres on television\n",
      "``My heart is with them,'' said Strawberry, who spoke to several Yankees after they won the American League championship\n",
      "``I'm just going to relax at home and watch the game\n",
      "I'm looking forward to it\n",
      "I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am.'' Paul O'Neill echoed the sentiments of many Yankees by saying, ``Everything we're going through is game\n",
      "This is his life\n",
      "Any time we get some good news about Darryl it's uplifting\n",
      "We're all praying for him.'' Since cancerous cells were found in one of the 36 lymph nodes removed from his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said doctors told him he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment once he returns to California\n",
      "The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he will need one treatment of at least one hour a week\n",
      "``I was never scared,'' said Strawberry\n",
      "``I was more emotional than anything\n",
      "At the time of it, I had played for a while with this\n",
      "I wanted to keep playing because I knew we were going to get into the World Series.'' At that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because the Yankees had made it to the World Series as he expected\n",
      "``I wanted to be there because that's what you play for,'' said Strawberry\n",
      "``I don't think that I was ever scared\n",
      "It's something that I wanted to deal with head on\n",
      "I talked to Eric Davis about the chemo\n",
      "He said it's not as bad as some people say.'' Although the discovery of cancer in one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained optimistic about his future and said, ``It didn't worry me\n",
      "I got all the information from the doctors\n",
      "One out of 36 is good\n",
      "It wasn't spreading\n",
      "It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can.'' When Strawberry was released from the hospital in a wheelchair Friday, a few hundred fans who had congregated chanted, ``Darryl, Darryl.'' Strawberry, who struggled not to cry, hugged a few nurses, thanked everyone for supporting him, then rose from the wheelchair and carefully entered a car\n",
      "``Wow, I never thought this day would come,'' Strawberry said\n",
      "``But it has.'' Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter in the World Series who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres in five games, Strawberry refused to make a prediction about whether he will soon be getting his third World Series ring\n",
      "But Strawberry, who is still hopeful about returning to play in 1999, sounded very confident in the 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 on the back of their caps as inspiration\n",
      "``They look really good,'' said Strawberry.'' It's not going to be easy, but I think they're ready\n",
      "The best thing about making it to the World Series is you know you don't have to go anywhere else after that\n",
      "You've made it to that point and then you go do the best you can do\n",
      "That's what it's all about.'' \n",
      "The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the first inning when his name was announced at Yankee Stadium for the first time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball last Wednesday\n",
      "There were no boos\n",
      "It was a very warm ovation\n",
      "They liked him\n",
      "They really liked him\n",
      "Knoblauch exhaled\n",
      "Knoblauch had emphasized before the game that he was concerned about winning and rumbling into the World Series, not about the fans\n",
      "But it surely made Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fans had forgiven him\n",
      "Victories, more than time, had healed the malice toward Knoblauch and he could play second base without earplugs\n",
      "When the Yankees defeated the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second World Series in three years, Knoblauch was easily the most relieved player on the field\n",
      "The awful mistake that he had made in Game 2 would be forgotten\n",
      "The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch was celebrating as much as anyone\n",
      "``To have them act like that toward me was tremendous,'' said Knoblauch, about the response that he received\n",
      "``It was a great feeling, and it really helped me out.'' Knoblauch was wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champions of the American League in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim as he spoke\n",
      "He did not look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot by being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are expected not to make\n",
      "``Just to face things and take it like a man and answer all the questions, although they're tough,'' Knoblauch said\n",
      "``You see what you're made of when you have to bounce back from something like that\n",
      "That's basically what I learned.'' If the Yankees had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that he would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball that glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside the baseline\n",
      "Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead run scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1\n",
      "Now Knoblauch can watch television and read the newspapers again without getting queasy\n",
      "``That's huge for him,'' David Cone said\n",
      "``That's huge for me\n",
      "I let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one if they would have come back and beat us\n",
      "And Knobbie, I'm sure he's feeling a lot better now.'' Knoblauch, who had two hits in five at-bats, was working on his second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters were allowed into the clubhouse\n",
      "He flashed the sort of smile that he had not shown too much recently and, now that the Yankees are in the World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about his mistake\n",
      "``Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that,'' Derek Jeter said\n",
      "``I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something good.'' \n",
      "The last time they were seen on the field at Yankee Stadium, they were inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the Cleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series\n",
      "That's not to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they have shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural progression of postseason games\n",
      "All right, so Ted Hendry won't be in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement with the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the World Series\n",
      "Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even though the agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division series and the World Series\n",
      "The three American League umpires who are on the six-man World Series crew did work in the first round of the playoffs\n",
      "One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and behind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium\n",
      "Gene Budig, the AL president, Friday called Garcia, a 24-year veteran, one of the league's ``most respected umpires.'' But after Saturday night, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2\n",
      "Now why does that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right field? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at Yankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship series two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey _ no name, please; he has been over-glorified enough _ reached over the fence and caught Derek Jeter's fly ball just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, prepared to catch it\n",
      "Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a home run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly showing interference\n",
      "Too late\n",
      "The call helped the Yankees win the first game and set the tone for the series\n",
      "``Even though he made a mistake, you know you have the best out there,'' a baseball official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said\n",
      "That knowledge comes as small consolation to the Orioles\n",
      "Budig, too, acknowledged that umpires, like players and managers, aren't perfect\n",
      "``Major league umpires are skilled at what they do, but they are human,'' he said in a telephone interview\n",
      "``Day in and day out they do a very good job for Major League Baseball\n",
      "Rounds one and two have been difficult, but that happens from time to time.'' The umpires were so human in the American League playoffs that it happened from time to time to time to time\n",
      "The Cleveland Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility of the umpires\n",
      "``We had a highlight reel of umpires getting knocked down by baseballs,'' general manager John Hart said after the Indians' final game against the Yankees\n",
      "``The umpires didn't lose the game for us, but we had our share of controversies in two playoff series with umpires.'' In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the plate umpire, was so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the plate that he immediately provoked disputes that led to his ejecting of Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitches into Game 2, and Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later\n",
      "Hendry was right or wrong, depending on one's point of view, for his noncall of interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of Game 2 of the ALCS\n",
      "That ruling went in favor of the Indians\n",
      "Little else did\n",
      "In Game 4, Jeter was stealing second in the fifth inning when the on-target throw from Sandy Alomar Jr\n",
      "hit Jim McKean, who jumped to try to get out of the way but instead kicked the ball into right field\n",
      "A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry in Game 6\n",
      "But the worst call of Game 6 was Hendry's on a force play at second base\n",
      "Hendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came off the base before he caught the ball\n",
      "Members of the Yankees indicated Friday that they, too, thought the call was wrong\n",
      "``I don't know,'' Williams said when asked what he thought, ``but I'll take it\n",
      "It was a big play.'' But did he think he was out? ``I'd rather not comment about that,'' he said\n",
      "``It will stir a lot of controversy\n",
      "I don't want to get into that.'' When a player believes he was safe, he says so and doesn't worry about any subsequent controversy\n",
      "If Williams was implying that he thought he was out, another member of the Yankees said he had no doubt that Williams was out\n",
      "``I wasn't sure at first,'' this uniformed member of the team said, ``but when I saw it was Hendry, I said uh-oh\n",
      "I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't come off the bag\n",
      "Then I saw the replay\n",
      "He was out.'' The game today is faster than it used to be, this observer said\n",
      "The umpires have to be sharper\n",
      "Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American League, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the National League, will be as sharp as an 18th century French guillotine in these four to seven games\n",
      "Leonard Coleman, the NL president, said he thought his umpires were first-rate in the division and league series and added that he has ``three splendid umpires'' working the World Series\n",
      "Budig said: ``The World Series crew is proven and first-rate\n",
      "We have total confidence in them.'' The umpires should let the players make the errors and the managers the bad decisions\n",
      "Then everyone will talk about the players and managers and not the umpires\n",
      "\n",
      "YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series\n",
      "David Wells is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional edge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less effective against left-handed pitching\n",
      "Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and earned the start in Game 2 of this series\n",
      "David Cone should benefit from six days' worth of rest when he starts Game 3, as well as being able to pitch in warm Southern California\n",
      "Mariano Rivera's stuff might be as good as it has been all year, and Mike Stanton continues to be a dominant postseason pitcher\n",
      "Reasons for concern: the erratic Andy Pettitte, who needs a home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches low and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command in his last brief outing\n",
      "Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming out of its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through the middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius has been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup\n",
      "But the Yankees do have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the fastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason funk is a problem\n",
      "The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge Posada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive pitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power\n",
      "Defense The Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle with Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius\n",
      "Nobody's really taken advantage of the fact that Williams has a poor arm in center field, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn will try\n",
      "The Indians did expose the fact that the Yankees' pitchers have trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third base\n",
      "Baserunning The Yankees run well as they take extra bases, particularly Paul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams can make mistakes\n",
      "The Yankees probably won't be able to steal against Kevin Brown, who has an effective slide step, but they could be aggressive against Andy Ashby, or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim Leyritz\n",
      "PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San Diego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the moment\n",
      "Tony Gwynn hasn't been as consistent as he usually is, Ken Caminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky\n",
      "But the Padres are a veteran team capable of putting the ball in play, getting runners on base and then moving them along, and so long as they are getting exceptional pitching, that's all they really need\n",
      "Quilvio Veras, the leadoff hitter, is adept at drawing walks and Steve Finley, who has become more pull conscious in the last two years, could try to take aim at the right field stands in Yankee Stadium\n",
      "Vaughn's power could be a factor if the Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough to keep him from leaning over the plate\n",
      "Pitching Kevin Brown is the best pitcher in this series, capable of winning three games if necessary, should Padres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7\n",
      "But at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy Ashby or Sterling Hitchcock\n",
      "When Ashby's right, he's hitting the corners with his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command is suspect, he gets pounded\n",
      "Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball to great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two rounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause him some concern\n",
      "San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect of the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side (the stuff of each has waned)\n",
      "But if a lead can be delivered into the hands of closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it\n",
      "Defense They mostly catch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they are unspectacular\n",
      "Shortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning double plays, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year; Wally Joyner has good hands at first; the center fielder Steve Finley is extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball to the infield\n",
      "Tony Gwynn's range is better toward the right field line, not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps\n",
      "The Yankees will be able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field\n",
      "Baserunning Veras can steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, as well\n",
      "In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding team, though Caminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't make mistakes on the bases\n",
      "PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, jam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed\n",
      "Steve Finley: A left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball\n",
      "Left-handers like David Wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside\n",
      "Tony Gwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible\n",
      "When he's not hitting well, he can be anxious early in the count, and he should be fed breaking balls out of the strike zone\n",
      "Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything high and over the plate\n",
      "Because he likes to pull the ball, you must pitch him on the outer edge, occasionally jamming him to keep him honest\n",

      "Taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts, the league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations\n",
      "``I'm very sad and disappointed,'' said the NBA commissioner, David Stern\n",
      "``I consider it to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done\n",
      "I do things that I like to think are in the best interests of the game\n",
      "And I believe this is.'' The decision came after what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player July 1\n",
      "Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix\n",
      "The talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners\n",
      "The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income\n",
      "The main sticking point has been the owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth\n",
      "While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address the exception in their taxation proposal\n",
      "The main points were as follows: _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their Bird rights\n",
      "For example, if a player made $20 million, the team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams\n",
      "``There could be provisions made for some players,'' said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union\n",
      "``We don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back\n",
      "And I think the league feels the same way.'' The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly as liberal\n",
      "_ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary\n",
      "Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year\n",
      "If the figure was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season\n",
      "But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit goes into effect\n",
      "_ Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts\n",
      "Players would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues\n",
      "The union said this clearly addresses the league's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues\n",
      "Since the owners re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal\n",
      "_ Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal\n",
      "Currently, the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota\n",
      "_ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance\n",
      "Details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision the owners included in their last proposal\n",
      "In return for the concessions, the players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $272,500 _ and creation of an average salary exception\n",
      "This would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary _ currently $2.6 million\n",
      "``We're buoyed by the fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal,'' the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said\n",
      "``I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we made a valiant effort.'' Asked if the players would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games, Hunter added: ``It's not about us blinking\n",
      "We want to reach an agreement\n",
      "We're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing\n",
      "Our position all along has been we don't want to accept a bad deal.'' Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason games\n",
      "He estimated the losses into the ``hundreds of millions of dollars.'' ``I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of needs we have economically,'' he added\n",
      "``But there's some possibility.'' Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted\n",
      "It doesn't look promising, but we're going to spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response.'' Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates\n",
      "Both sides reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and preserving the NBA's perfect record\n",
      "Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord\n",
      "``I'd like to think these our the last games we have to cancel,'' Granik said\n",

      "Called the Larry Bird exception, it was created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign with the Celtics near the end of his career\n",
      "Michael Jordan exercised the clause the last two years with the Chicago Bulls, earning more than $30 million per season _ figures more than $5 million more what a team is allowed to spend on all its players\n",
      "But with exorbitant salaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and $100 million deals sprouting up routinely, the owners are determined to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a restricted salary cap _ a hard cap _ and putting a ceiling on how much one player could earn\n",
      "``Last year, the players received about $1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement\n",
      "``Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $750,000\n",
      "Unfortunately, the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration to what we have offered.'' Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic projections, and shot down a number of new proposals presented to the players on Sept\n",
      "25\n",
      "``If they had left the current deal in place, we would have gotten much of that anyway,'' he added\n",
      "``All we're saying is, we're not in position to accept a hard cap.'' Monday's decision to cancel the preseason came less than two weeks after the NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week of exhibition games\n",
      "Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $35 million and $40 million\n",
      "Decisions about the cancellations of regular season games are expected to be made next week, he added\n",
      "A league official said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two weeks, depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations\n",
      "Thursday's bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the season on time\n",
      "``Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have no reason to believe they will on Thursday,'' Granik said\n",
      "Added Hunter: ``Of course they don't expect much to get done\n",
      "When Russ and David decide the negotiations are going to be real and substantive, then something will happen\n",
      "What they're banking on now is that the players are going to miss paychecks and cave in November\n",
      "It's as if they've ingested something that has to pass\n",
      "And once it passes, then they'll negotiate.'' \n",
      "As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball Association and its players is weird even by sports standards\n",
      "There is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season will be canceled\n",
      "In this union battle it is the interests of the best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the discussion\n",
      "And here it is some of the workers, not the management, who are considering trying to make the union disappear\n",
      "The current arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions\n",
      "Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum, then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans\n",
      "The number of players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class, in NBA terms _ fell sharply\n",
      "But Michael Jordan made $33 million\n",
      "This should not be a surprise\n",
      "Sports is an entertainment business, not unlike movies\n",
      "Big stars get millions, while most get union scale\n",
      "Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed\n",
      "The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay\n",
      "When that was adopted, it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could pay\n",
      "But it has not worked out that way\n",
      "In the current negotiation, the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises for veterans\n",
      "The union says it is worried about that middle class, but seems determined to preserve the free market\n",
      "The league got its broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay this year's television fees whether or not there are any games to broadcast\n",
      "(They will be paid back in later years, either through reduced fees or extra games to show.) Owners hoped the players would think management was willing to wait them out, and come to terms with only a small part of the season canceled\n",
      "But the union is acting unhurried\n",
      "It turned aside requests for negotiations this week, saying the players had to meet first\n",
      "Then there is the issue of union suicide, a tactic that was rejected by the players in 1995\n",
      "The idea is that if the players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws for the owners to collude\n",
      "The sky would be the limit\n",
      "That tactic might fail\n",
      "The courts could reject a union decertification vote as a sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel free to offer less than the old union minimum\n",
      "But if the players go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get going\n",
      "Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owners this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity\n",
      "That was what all the seers said four years ago, when baseball's World Series was canceled by labor troubles\n",
      "But fan memories are relatively short, and now baseball seems more popular than ever\n",
      "With that in mind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months\n",

      "The National Basketball Association, embroiled in a labor dispute with its players, Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the 1998-99 season\n",
      "It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games\n",
      "The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel\n",
      "The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov\n",
      "3 and Nov\n",
      "16 came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said they would respond to by Friday\n",
      "``We tried our best today to try to do what was possible to salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center\n",
      "``Unfortunately, it didn't work out.'' After 35,001 games without a blemish, the NBA now joins the National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major League Baseball in having lost games to a labor dispute\n",
      "Taking into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts, the league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further cancellations\n",
      "``I'm very sad and disappointed,'' said the NBA commissioner, David Stern\n",
      "``I consider it to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else we could have done\n",
      "I do things that I like to think are in the best interests of the game\n",
      "And I believe this is.'' The decision came after what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player July 1\n",
      "Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix\n",
      "The talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners\n",
      "The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income\n",
      "The main sticking point has been the owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth\n",
      "While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did address the exception in their taxation proposal\n",
      "The main points were as follows: _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $18 million, a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their Bird rights\n",
      "For example, if a player made $20 million, the team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams\n",
      "``There could be provisions made for some players,'' said Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union\n",
      "``We don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan back\n",
      "And I think the league feels the same way.'' The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly as liberal\n",
      "_ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary\n",
      "Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year\n",
      "If the figure was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season\n",
      "But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit goes into effect\n",
      "_ Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts\n",
      "Players would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth in league revenues\n",
      "The union said this clearly addresses the league's desire to bring salaries in line with revenues\n",
      "Since the owners re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal\n",
      "_ Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years of his deal\n",
      "Currently, the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota\n",
      "_ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance\n",
      "Details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions took place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision the owners included in their last proposal\n",
      "In return for the concessions, the players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $272,500 _ and creation of an average salary exception\n",
      "This would allow every team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the average salary _ currently $2.6 million\n",
      "``We're buoyed by the fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal,'' the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said\n",
      "``I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we made a valiant effort.'' Asked if the players would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games, Hunter added: ``It's not about us blinking\n",
      "We want to reach an agreement\n",
      "We're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing\n",
      "Our position all along has been we don't want to accept a bad deal.'' Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason games\n",
      "He estimated the losses into the ``hundreds of millions of dollars.'' ``I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can address the kind of needs we have economically,'' he added\n",
      "``But there's some possibility.'' Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we wanted\n",
      "It doesn't look promising, but we're going to spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response.'' Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates\n",
      "Both sides reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and preserving the NBA's perfect record\n",
      "Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord\n",
      "``I'd like to think these our the last games we have to cancel,'' Granik said\n",
      "``But unless this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy.'' \n",
      "He was the classic small-town prodigy, with the creativity of a big-city profiteer\n",
      "When there was no shot to take, he invented a new one\n",
      "When there was no one to pass to, he reconfigured the play until a teammate was open\n",
      "Larry Bird, in the Indiana countryside or inside Boston Garden, was a luminous exception to the governing rule\n",
      "That is why, six years after his retirement from the National Basketball Association, his name is again basketball's most prominent, beginning with his induction to the Hall of Fame before 7,000 Bird watchers at the Civic Center here on Friday night\n",
      "Deservedly enshrined as forever exceptional, he again becomes Bird, the exception, the case study for a contentious and potentially disastrous labor war\n",
      "``No, not really,'' Bird said, when I asked whether he is troubled by the likelihood of his legendary name soon representing a symbol of greed to unsympathetic millions\n",
      "``There's always a player's name attached to these things\n",
      "I know at the time I was very happy about it.'' That would have been 1988, when the Celtics wanted to compensate Bird with a $4.9 million bonus to push through his back pain, go on as their savior\n",
      "Three years later, in a contract arbitration involving the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would contend that the NBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap, in order to satisfy Bird\n",
      "Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this salary cap is convoluted enough to give anyone a headache, so let's just say it is a cap that does not exist when a team is negotiating with one of its own\n",
      "The process of unsealing the cap to re-sign a particular player eventually became known as making use of the Larry Bird exception\n",
      "And that is where we stand, as this onetime exception has become the very expensive rule the owners don't want to play by anymore\n",
      "``I can understand both sides,'' said Bird, safely in the middle, between Bird, the former exception, and Bird, the present Indiana Pacers' coach\n",
      "``Without getting into the exception, I think it's very important for players to stay in the same place.'' Important, he meant, for franchise stability and fan identification\n",
      "``You have a son who is 7 years old, he goes from 7 to 17 in the 10 years you've played,'' Bird said\n",
      "``A lot of people in Boston told me that they had followed me, from the time they were very young to when they were in college.'' The Bird years numbered only three Celtics championships, but he was the best player pro basketball's most famous team ever had\n",
      "He and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began during a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, like an infectious smile\n",
      "They stood for the pass, for team play, but now their decade of selflessness has given way to one of selfishness\n",
      "The NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater heights than anyone imagined it could, but it is a league that now suffers from a sickness of the soul\n",
      "``If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not survive what we're about to go through,'' said Bill Fitch, Bird's first Celtics coach, who, with Bill Walton, stood with him on the night that, he said, gave closure to his playing career\n",
      "The owners, as always, are exaggerating their misery, but this time, it is much easier to not root for the players\n",
      "The president of the union is Ewing, who one day commands players to boycott the world championships because the NBA's corporate fingerprints are on them, then the next day helps himself to some television commentary work for David Stern's women's annex\n",
      "Ewing leads the fight to protect the $100 million contracts for 21-year-olds who have achieved not a single playoff victory, linked to the big payoffs for agents like his friend Falk\n",
      "The battle is waged in the name of a salary cap that makes exceptions of the unexceptional, rewards everyone as if they were Bird\n",
      "``I believe that in any field there has to be an allowance for the truly special ones,'' Walton said\n",
      "``But that group is very small\n",
      "When I was growing up in this sport, the only players who got the recognition were the champions, the ones who always made you feel good about the game, about sports\n",
      "That's how Larry and Magic played, always dreaming of the special team\n",
      "It wasn't about hype, about money.'' That is not quite the case, nor should it have been\n",
      "Bird was a businessman's ball player from the day he arrived, with his flannel shirts and blue-collar ethic\n",
      "He hired the late Bob Woolf, one of the original heavy-hitting agents, and got himself a record rookie contract\n",
      "Then he went out and turned a 29-victory catastrophe into a 61-victory contender\n",
      "A rare Bird, an honest exception to the rule\n",
      "\n",
      "The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing sides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement\n",
      "Still, a five-hour meeting that was described as cordial by the league and ``almost like two bulls letting off a little steam'' by the players association produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday\n",
      "Barring a major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full season and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season games to labor strife in November\n",
      "Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before deciding to cancel regular-season games\n",
      "He also discussed the possibility of a significantly shortened season\n",
      "``We haven't made a determination that you need this exact number of games in order to have a representative season,'' Granik said\n",
      "``But we recognize that beyond a certain point we can't possibly sell to our fans that we're having an NBA season\n",
      "``Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet\n",
      "We have a few months before we have to face that decision.'' Perhaps the only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown Manhattan hotel was a question-and-answer session over the league's latest proposal to the players\n",
      "Patrick Ewing, the union president, and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the meeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union lawyers\n",
      "No owners were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern and the league's lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies of a two-week-old proposal to the players\n",
      "At one point before the two parties broke for lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voices and accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly, a participant in the meeting said\n",
      "But the two were seen shaking hands and laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after 3 p.m\n",
      "``There was some venting from both sides,'' Hunter said\n",
      "``We've been placid and very respectful\n",
      "Today, we took the coats off and we were inclined to take the gloves off a little bit\n",
      "Having done that, I think it kind of loosened up both sides.'' Hunter added: ``Did anybody blink today? They're sort of look at us for any kind of nuance they can find during the course of negotiations that might, in some way or another, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing we might be open to something else\n",
      "We're looking at their body language, too\n",
      "I don't think that they're ready to make a deal.'' The last formal meeting between both sides on Aug\n",

      "More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have major ramifications on American sports-labor law\n",
      "But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries\n",
      "NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the decision goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated by appealing to the U.S\n",

      "District Court in Manhattan\n",
      "If the players win the ruling, the NBA intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick\n",
      "The motion was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the matter\n",
      "``If he rules in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit and the resolve of the players,'' said Billy Hunter, union executive director\n",
      "``But we understand that won't end the lockout\n",
      "It just means they have to pay 200-some players\n",
      "And there is still other litigation alive that may take a while to resolve\n",
      "At most, it's a hollow victory.'' Feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render his decision\n",
      "Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully\n",
      "There is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid\n",
      "During the NBA summer lockout of 1995, players who missed paychecks did not file a grievance\n",
      "Neither did National Hockey League players who were locked out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season\n",
      "The union argued that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player contracts\n",
      "In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding payment during a lockout\n",
      "The league is relying on the basic tenets of labor law, which hold that employees not be paid during strikes or lockouts\n",
      "A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners\n",
      "The deterrent factor of a lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to reach a new agreement\n",
      "If Feerick finds in favor of the players, there will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts to reach an agreement quickly\n",
      "They would essentially be paid for not playing basketball\n",
      "If Feerick finds in favor of the owners, the reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement more quickly\n",
      "But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference call Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled before the players would back away from their ultimate goals\n",
      "``I'm not at all concerned,'' Hunter said\n",
      "``There's been no demonstration that there's going to be a change in our resolve\n",
      "After the players saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA owners, well, I had two players call me up and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing to hock everything they've got.'' Another significant development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the dispute is settled, according to at least two player agents\n",
      "``I think it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people talking about that,'' said Bill Strickland, a member of the union's agents advisory committee\n",
      "Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, said he would explore the possibility that one client, Nets center Rony Seikaly, would sign with a professional team in Greece\n",

      "``But we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy commissioner, said the league has approved the idea of players' earning a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled\n",
      "Proposals exchanged last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations since the lockout began July 1\n",
      "But both sides have termed the figures in each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it was unclear whether either side was willing compromise\n",
      "``I don't think we should get too carried away about the possibilities just yet,'' Granik said\n",
      "``When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the players at their word that they wanted to make some headway\n",
      "But to call their first proposal meaningless is charitable\n",
      "They proposed something that has no impact\n",
      "As it stands, that can't be the solution.'' The owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation to leaguewide revenue over the next three years, while the players want to keep earning as much as possible\n",

      "On Monday, White House negotiators, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, tried to determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for six months the departments of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau\n",
      "The deal would put off until next March the contentious issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of counting people\n",

      "The Democrats met in the office of Minority Leader Dick Gephardt\n",
      "The rationale for the half-year financing is that by next March the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether using sampling is legal or constitutional\n",

We made it very clear that unless the census was included, along with some other issues, like school construction, the deal wouldn't be acceptable.'' Statistical sampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate populations that are difficult to count, and would have the largest effect on the counting of African-Americans in cities and blacks and Hispanics in rural areas, groups that are traditionally undercounted by the standard means\n",

      "The proposal to finance the departments of Commerce, Justice and State for six months is similar to one reached last November between Bowles and House Speaker Newt Gingrich\n",
      "The idea then was that holding all three departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling\n",

      "The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document\n",

      "Excluded were the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees, who now must write the language that will put the deal into law\n",
      "Almost everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with the biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the $20 billion taken from the surplus to address so-called emergencies and for the package's failure to offer voters a serious tax cut\n",
      "The lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some conservatives nervous that more members will try to add provisions that will further expand a bill they already consider overly bloated\n",

      "Despite continued growth of the Chinese economy, exports to China have slowed dramatically and imports of Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately seeks to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in Asia\n",

      "But he discussed Brazil as an opportunity to engage in the kind of preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocated in speeches to the IMF and the World Bank here three weeks ago\n",
      "At the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should ``provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial contagion'' rather than wait for disaster to strike\n",
      "Direct U.S\n",
      "aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not only for Brazil but to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico and other countries that are major U.S\n",
      "trading partners\n",
      "That would be a change of strategy\n",
      "So far, the United States has operated almost entirely through international financial institutions, chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky move for President Clinton, economically and politically\n",
      "Even though Congress objected to the $20 billion in U.S\n",
      "funds committed to the bailout of Mexico, it turned out that only $12 billion was ultimately needed, and it has since been paid back, with interest\n",
      "But Rubin noted on Friday that ``it's a very different environment now.'' Other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct U.S\n",
      "participation in a Brazil bailout\n",
      "``I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what could happen in their own districts,'' a White House official said last week, ``and they won't say much as long as they don't have to vote on it.'' By acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency\n",
      "Whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since Thailand's currency crisis in July 1997 is a matter of considerable debate\n",
      "But many experts cite the confluence of several events that have reassured jittery investors around the world: two successive interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's long-delayed move to prop up its banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer funds, and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing to return\n",
      "Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on markets, Rubin acknowledged that ``in the last several weeks there have been a number of significant, positive developments.'' But the former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market rallies, warned that ``serious issues remain'' and that ``it will take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has repeatedly called ``the most serious international financial disruption of the last 50 years.'' In fact, Rubin's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries to borrow money on world markets\n",
      "``Brazil and Japan are the two obvious tinderboxes,'' said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, who served as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during Clinton's first term\n",
      "``In Brazil, the issue is whether the package that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an exploding debt problem\n",
      "And in Japan the question is whether there is real reform that goes along with the money.'' But after spending 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese, Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not lack of resources\n",
      "In Brazil, though, the United States has a better chance of buying time and influencing an economic reform program, as long as it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Cardoso and his team\n",
      "But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt administration to help stabilize the dollar\n",
      "The money is under Rubin's control, with presidential approval, and he reached into it to circumvent congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995\n",
      "But the reaction was so strong _ for a time Congress restricted tapping the fund for international bailouts _ that Rubin has been extraordinarily cautious ever since\n",
      "He committed $3 billion in a ``second line of defense'' in emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year, but no money was ultimately dispersed to either country\n",
      "U.S\n",
      "officials said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct U.S\n",
      "aid\n",
      "In the bailout of Russia _ whose economy collapsed after President Boris Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the economy and dismissed the leading reformers _ the United States offered no direct help\n",
      "Those events set off a panicked exit by investors from all emerging markets, and greatly worsened Brazil's troubles\n",
      "So far, Brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF, convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against the country\n",
      "But at the same time, the Brazilian officials have maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash _ and are certainly in no hurry to get it\n",
      "U.S\n",
      "officials and top officials of the IMF are clearly nervous, worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater will be the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market turmoil\n",
      "``The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under control,'' said an investment banker involved in the talks\n",
      "``But the fact is that there's still a real risk that sometime in the next 18 months the government is going to be forced to devalue'' its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5 percent a year in a carefully controlled fall\n",
      "To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian government has had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, choking off credit for most companies\n",
      "Meanwhile, the country is slipping into recession\n",
      "The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it is contingent on Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to end huge deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending\n",
      "The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's austerity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's elections but before the international package, to avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions to Brazil\n",
      "``Brazil has to do a lot,'' Fischer said last week before leaving on his trip\n",
      "``In return, I expect the international community will make a large contribution.'' \n",
      "Latin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global financial crisis\n",

      "An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue facing the world at the moment\n",
      "``I don't know if we are coming to the end of the world economic order\n",
      "It will be interesting to know,'' the Cuban leader said at a hotel press conference shortly after his arrival for the annual Ibero-American summit\n",
      "Emphasizing the scale of the threat, Castro said President Clinton was aware that ``if South America falls into crisis, it will be extended inevitably also to the United States,'' which is heavily involved in investments and loans in the region\n",

      "Diplomats said there was consensus on the form of the final statement\n",
      "The declaration ``calls on the international community, and Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary measures to promote stability in international financial markets, which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,'' said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry\n",
      "Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory system for global financial transactions that would place controls on speculators, like measures to slow down the internatioal flow of money\n",
      "They also want reforms that allow international financial institutions to head off crises rather than react to them with rescue packages\n",
      "``International institutions must be active in tackling crises like the recent one ..\n",

      "Brazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy\n",
      "A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000\n",
      "The statement was issued after weekend talks between IMF officials and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Finance Ministry\n",
      "Representatives of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank took part in the talks\n",
      "Both organizations as well as private banks are expected to contribute to the rescue package\n",
      "Brazil is the latest country to be hit by the financial crisis that began 15 months ago in Asia and then spread to Russia\n",

      "Cardoso is preparing an emergency program of budget cuts to restore investor confidence and prevent a devaluation of the country's currency\n",
      "Investors want Cardoso to outline the plans this week but he is expected to wait until after Sunday's second round of elections for state governors, whose support he needs for his budget cuts\n",
      "The joint statement said the Brazil-IMF discussions ``were aimed at preparing the ground for prompt support by the international community, including the IMF, for the multi-year fiscal program to be announced soon by the Brazilian authorities, which will include new policy initiatives.'' The statement reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would '' fulfill the government target of stabilizing the ratio of net consolidated public sector debt to GDP by the year 2000.'' The two sides are to continue their talks ``with the objective of reaching early agreement,'' the statement said\n",

      "Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end bonus\n",
      "So they're considering paying with products instead of cash\n",
      "Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things as hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash bonus that normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the head of Brazil's largest federation of trade unions\n",
      "``The idea is completely unacceptable,'' said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general of the federation, which represents more than 2,000 unions and 19 million workers\n",
      "``We will recommend our unions reject such a preposterous proposal.'' But strapped for cash and punished by high interest rates and declining sales, factory owners may have no other choice, said Joseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small Industries, which represents 110,000 factories that employ nearly 800,000 workers\n",
      "``Access to credit is almost impossible,'' Curi said\n",
      "``If banks and the government don't create some kind of emergency credit line, the only option many of our associates will have will be to use products to pay the bonus.'' Factories that produce clothes, shoes, food, toys and household appliances were ``the most enthusiastic about the idea,'' Curi said\n",
      "Curi predicted even harsher times for Brazil with the belt-tightening austerity package newly re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is expected to announce Tuesday\n",
      "The measures, aimed at curbing the country's ballooning budget deficit _ equal to about 7 percent of gross domestic product _ are expected to include spending cuts and, possibly, more taxes\n",
      "``There is a lot of talk of increasing taxes, which means less cash circulating in the market and more credit restrictions,'' Curi said\n",
      "``It is a shortsighted approach that will spell more recession and the collapse of many small factories.'' Brazil has been a major casualty of the global economic crisis, buffeted by loss of investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital\n",
      "The country's foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion, from dlrs 70 billion at the end of July\n",
      "In an effort to prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the real, and stem capital flight, interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year\n",
      "For union leader Felicio, the proposed product-for-cash swap ``is a clear sign of the despair the business sector is feeling because of the recessive economic policies'' brought by the Real Plan, the economic stabilization program put together in 1994 when Cardoso was finance minister\n",
      "The plan succeeded in slashing inflation from 2,400 percent to almost zero today\n",
      "But it also brought recession and unemployment, which now stands at almost 8 percent, the highest in a decade\n",
      "\n",
      "President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to repair the largest economy in Latin America may depend on the outcome of this weekend's gubernatorial elections\n",
      "Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence\n",
      "But his plan, expected to be unveiled next week, must be approved by Congress, and state governors have enormous sway over local delegations\n",
      "``The influence governors have on their congressional blocs is overwhelming,'' said University of Sao Paulo political scientist Eduardo Kugelmas\n",

      "On Sunday, voters return to the polls for runoff elections in 12 states and in the Federal District of Brasilia\n",
      "The outcome will likely determine how successful Cardoso is in getting Congress to approve his economic program, which is aimed at trimming the budget deficit\n",
      "New income, fuel and bank transaction taxes are expected to be proposed\n",
      "Kugelmas said opponents of the president stand a good chance of winning in four large states _ Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul\n",
      "``If they win, the president will face a tough uphill battle,'' he said\n",
      "Cardoso needs the governors' support not only in influencing the congressional delegations, but also in holding down their own spending\n",
      "``The problem is that none of the candidates in Sunday's elections ..\n",
      "wants to be identified with unpopular austerity measures,'' said Kugelmas\n",
      "``So they promise to spend more money on schools, hospitals and public work projects.'' Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity plans\n",
      "With more than 34 million inhabitants, nearly equal to the entire population of neighboring Argentina, it alone accounts for more than one-third of Brazil's economic output and 70 of the 513 congressional seats\n",
      "While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally who is seeking re-election, has committed himself to the austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is a question mark\n",
      "``If Maluf wins, he will use his victory as a launching pad to the presidency in 2003,'' Kugelmas predicted\n",
      "``And that means he will try to stay as far away as possible from any austerity measure.'' \n",

      "His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted them\n",
      "From Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to honor the The slight, soft-spoken 21-year-old Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, who became an overnight symbol of anti-gay violence after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby\n",

      "``People have likened it to a scarecrow\n",
      "But it sounded more like a crucifixion.'' Police in Laramie, Wyo., where the beating took place, have said they believed robbery was the primary motive for the attack against Shepard, which occurred outside a bar in the town of 27,000\n",
      "But investigators also said Shepard's sexuality may have been a factor\n",
      "Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making a pass at him\n",
      "Monday, police said that after leaving Shepard tied to the fence, the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a street corner with two Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales, 19, and Jeremy Herrera, 18\n",
      "McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the brawl; McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same hospital where Shepard died\n",
      "Gay leaders hope _ and Christian conservatives fear _ that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws\n",
      "Conservatives generally oppose such laws because they favor one group's rights over another\n",

Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into just passing all kinds of new hate-crimes laws\n",
      "Be very careful of any changes and be sure you're not taking away rights of others in the process to race to this.'' Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed Monday said they would respect the family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday\n",

      "Citing the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: ``The discourse in society leaves many of these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable.''

      "Citing the need for hate crime laws to send a clear message to gay bashers, Levin said: ``The discourse in society leaves many of these people to believe that what they are doing is socially acceptable.'' While some gay leaders saw crucifixion imagery in Shepard's death, others saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a ranch fence as a warning to future intruders\n",

      "In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician in upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week that she was setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility that the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot\n",
      "The unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies\n",
      "But the main work of looking into the shooting of Dr\n",
      "Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits a larger pattern of organized violence will be done by the FBI, which has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism\n",
      "For many in the FBI, that's a problem\n",
      "In contrast to the old image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery on political groups, a number of senior FBI agents privately expressed misgivings about the attorney general's latest task force, the second she has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence\n",
      "FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation could drive the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates inquiries into criminal activity from those into political causes and unpopular ideas\n",
      "Today's agents are eager to disassociate themselves from the old J\n",
      "Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of political dissidents in the guise of serious investigations\n",
      "They do not want the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological war between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against clinics and doctors\n",
      "Many of those calling for government help were once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil rights activists\n",
      "Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, were starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay as the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence program that allowed agents to spy on, burgle, wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil rights groups like Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee\n",
      "Some officials are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill doctors who perform abortions\n",
      "They came up empty handed when Reno ordered the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a Florida doctor and his bodyguard\n",
      "The Justice Department conducted a two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursued some anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams\n",
      "But investigators never found a specific plot against abortion clinics and staff members\n",
      "Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem\n",
      "The FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield of politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of anti-government militias, environmental and Christian extremists, white separatists, animal rights activists and Islamic fundamentalists\n",
      "``The FBI is very quick to jump from investigating crime to investigating political association,'' said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University\n",
      "``When you move from investigating crimes to investigating groups, that all-important nexus to criminal conduct gets lost, the focus gets broader and broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful political activity.'' In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995 and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency has increased efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program\n",
      "In such cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies said they operate under domestic security guidelines that require investigators to find a ``reasonable indication'' that a group is planning to break the law before they can open an inquiry into an organization\n",
      "Before the authorities can use such intrusive tactics as wiretapping or property searches, they must have specific evidence\n",
      "Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the threat posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to local authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some groups\n",
      "Their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little real danger\n",
      "Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group, drifting along society's frayed margins, ``off the grid,'' as some agents describe it, without the usual ties to family, friends or work\n",
      "The profile fits Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for bombings at the Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion clinics\n",
      "He has kept his beliefs mostly to himself, although acquaintances hint that he was familiar with religious extremism and hate groups\n",
      "In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a material witness in the killing of Slepian, left a trail of clues about his motives\n",
      "He was an early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue\n",
      "Later, Kopp was associated with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant anti-abortion group\n",
      "One law-enforcement official said that the government should do what it does best\n",
      "``We should investigate violations,'' he said\n",
      "``We shouldn't investigate groups.'' \n",
      "Rosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of Life rallies, in which hundreds were arrested\n",
      "She was there before Lambs of Christ demonstrators came to town in 1993\n",
      "She was on the sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices the morning of Oct\n",
      "23, about 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, was fatally shot in his home\n",
      "And she was there Friday, brown rosary beads in her hands, a small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly praying for abortions to stop\n",
      "``I'm heartbroken when I have to come here,'' Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio, 58, said as she stood in the cold, wearing small black earmuffs and a white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver pin of baby feet\n",
      "``It's very difficult out here; I depend on God,'' she said, after praying for several moments to decide whether to talk to a reporter\n",
      "The bombings, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents and the posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the news media, but people like Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio are the foot soldiers in the abortion battle\n",
      "They call themselves street counselors and come to the clinic whenever they believe abortions are being performed\n",
      "They pray and they talk to women, hoping to change their minds\n",
      "Some scream profanities\n",
      "Others, like Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio, denounce not only the violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients\n",
      "For the approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest is more like a job than a political activity\n",
      "There is a schedule\n",
      "People count on them to show up\n",
      "Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother of six, connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in which she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy\n",
      "Two decades later, she was haunted by her own question: whether the fetus was male or female\n",
      "``I just felt horrible and I felt guilty,'' she said, tears in her eyes\n",
      "``I thought that if I was at the clinic doing something, I could make up for that baby's life.'' During Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio's 8 a.m.-to-10 a.m\n",
      "shift Friday, about a dozen people circled the area in front of the Buffalo clinic, saying the ``Hail Mary.'' Others take her spot on Tuesdays and Wednesdays\n",
      "She returns on Saturdays, when up to 40 people crowd the sidewalk\n",
      "Similar bands of protesters march in front of abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local protesters are often joined by bands of people who roam the country\n",
      "At the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there is an odd sense of community\n",
      "Local protesters greet Dick, the security guard, by name\n",
      "They sometimes see the ``enemy'' _ abortion-rights volunteers who escort patients in and out of the clinic _ in the supermarket or on the soccer field\n",
      "Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even spent two hours talking about abortion over breakfast last year with Slepian\n",
      "And several said they cried when they heard of Slepian's death\n",
      "Most of the protesters, including Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio, were among the thousands of people arrested here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion activity in Buffalo\n",
      "But if Operation Rescue returns, as planned, for a Spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio said, she will not be there\n",
      "Instead, she plans to stay in church and pray, to avoid the militancy she says she finds uncomfortable\n",
      "Glenn Murray, a lawyer for Womenservices clinic, said: ``When people from out of town show up, that is when we feel the most danger\n",
      "The local people are a known quantity\n",
      "We know most of the local people by name.'' Buffalo has been among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the last decade\n",
      "It is a heavily Catholic city where thousands of protesters from around the country demonstrated for two weeks in 1992\n",
      "They failed to close abortion clinics, but 500 people were arrested in rallies that snarled traffic and drew national headlines\n",
      "Those rallies, as well as earlier protests and continuing sidewalk vigils, have had an impact, people on both sides of the abortion issue say\n",
      "The number of clinics performing abortions in the Buffalo area has dropped to one from three\n",
      "And after Slepian's death and the retirement this week of another doctor, there are only two doctors in the area for whom abortions form a significant part of their practices\n",
      "The daily demonstrators count this as progress\n",
      "But their perch outside the clinic means they witness far more of what they believe are murders than what they call rescues\n",
      "About 30 women a day might go into the clinic\n",
      "After eight years, Mrs\n",
      "Lotempio can count eight women who changed their minds and did not get abortions while she was at the clinic\n",
      "Inside the clinic, the protests just make a hard job harder, many clinic workers say\n",
      "While some demonstrators simply repeat the rosary, other protesters call out to patients as they drive into the parking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike front\n",
      "They ask questions like ``Do you know what your baby looks like?'' or ``Is it a boy or a girl?'' Sometimes they accuse people of murder and torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation\n",
      "Federal law bars protesters from coming within 15 feet of the clinic entrances, and from leaning signs against its walls\n",
      "Some push the limits, frustrating clinic workers and guards\n",
      "The rules protect people from physical harassment, but because of the distance, they turn what could be quiet conversations into catcalls and taunts\n",
      "When a patient goes into the clinic, the protesters ``take on a different persona,'' said Melinda DuBois, director of the Buffalo clinic\n",
      "``They scream and yell and call us names\n",
      "They lie\n",
      "Some days we're immune to it, but other days it's just too much.'' Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, said she identified with the clinic patients\n",
      "When she was 23, she said, she struggled with the difficulties of being unmarried and pregnant herself, but decided to have her child, and married the father\n",
      "She began protesting in 1990, after attending an abortion protest march in Albany\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the night from his home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was in the van riding alongside him, according to former leaders of Operation Rescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity\n",
      "And, those people say, when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's ``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into jail\n",
      "Along with more than one hundred other Operation Rescue members, according to some people who were there, Kopp remained in jail for 40 days and adhered to Terry's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts\n",
      "After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, and was there working alongside Terry as the group's power and influence in the anti-abortion movement surged in late 1988 and 1989, according to the former leaders of Operation Rescue\n",
      "Now, Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authorities for questioning as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician who performed abortions in the Buffalo region\n",
      "The authorities also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and upstate New York\n",
      "Some abortion-rights groups are seizing on Kopp's role in Operation Rescue to raise new questions about the connections between the recent anti-abortion violence and the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups that burst onto the national scene in the late 1980s\n",
      "For years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have looked in vain for evidence to determine whether a national conspiracy might be behind a series of clinic bombings and shootings of doctors and other clinic staff members that began in the early 1990s\n",
      "A federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., that looked into conspiracy allegations was ultimately disbanded without finding a national underground\n",
      "But some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may help provide such a link\n",
      "In fact, the announcement that law enforcement officials are looking for him has been made as Attorney General Janet Reno has prepared to revive an interagency task force to look once again for possible conspiracies behind anti-abortion crimes\n",
      "Federal law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp is not now a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct\n",
      "23 that killed Dr\n",
      "Barnett A\n",
      "Slepian near Buffalo\n",
      "But they say Kopp's car was seen near Slepian's home in Amherst, N.Y\n",
      "in the weeks before the doctor was shot\n",
      "One day after issuing a warrant for Kopp's arrest as a material witness, law enforcement officials from at least 10 agencies spanning the United States and Canadian border still had not located Kopp Thursday\n",
      "But law enforcement officials said they were pursuing many tips, including about 400 that have poured into the FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184\n",
      "The police have gone through photographs of abortion protesters and clinic workers in Buffalo and around the country, and they are also reviewing hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in search of Kopp's face\n",
      "At this point, officials consider the shooting of Slepian to be connected to three attacks in Canada and one in Rochester on doctors who provide abortions\n",
      "The five attacks, all since 1994, occurred in the weeks leading up to Nov\n",
      "11, Veterans Day _ called Remembrance Day in Canada _ a holiday that has become important to anti-abortion activists\n",
      "But the attacks were spread over four years and 3,000 miles, from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Buffalo\n",
      "As is the case with many early veterans of Operation Rescue, Kopp was transformed into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in jail in Atlanta in 1988, according to many people who were in jail with him who insisted on anonymity\n",
      "\n",
      "While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday to honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become a chilling vigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement\n",
      "There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed to be at large\n",
      "And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this country where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find access diminishing\n",
      "There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day to commemorate aborted fetuses\n",
      "Three times since 1994, a sniper has used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor who performs abortion, each time wounding the target\n",
      "The attacks were spread across Canada _ Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia\n",
      "U.S\n",
      "and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were linked to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate New York, including the Oct\n",
      "23 slaying of Dr\n",
      "Barnett Slepian at his home near Buffalo\n",
      "An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted for questioning about the shootings\n",
      "Police say they don't know which side of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinics and hospitals throughout Canada\n",
      "``You must realize Canada has the largest undefended border in the world,'' said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation\n",
      "Many women's clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions have been urged to take precautions\n",
      "``I would suggest they be extremely aware of their day-to-day goings on, whether during their business day or after hours,'' said Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings\n",
      "Across Canada, there have been reports of obstetrician-gynecologists modifying their practices or deciding to stop performing abortions\n",
      "Some wear bulletproof vests and hang sheets over windows of their homes\n",
      "Abortion-rights groups say most doctors are not backing down\n",
      "``There's a great deal of sadness,'' said Susan Fox, director of a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, that provides abortions\n",
      "``But there's also a feeling of determination that we won't be deterred or scared by these actions.'' Marilyn Wilson, executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, sees a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young doctors from entering the field\n",
      "``There are almost no doctors who have stopped performing these procedures, even under the current reign of terror,'' she said\n",
      "``But young doctors with families wouldn't necessarily want to do this\n",
      "They may not be willing to put their lives at risk.'' The abortion debate is only one of several factors contributing to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada\n",
      "The national society that oversees the speciality says there are about 1,400 doctors in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most are in their 50s or 60s\n",
      "The society says long hours and limits on fees paid by the public health-care system are causing burnout and deterring medical school graduates as they choose a specialty\n",
      "Another problem is that few Canadian medical schools offer training in abortion\n",
      "Women in Canada's big cities generally have adequate access to abortions\n",
      "Those in rural areas often face long journeys, and the province of Prince Edward Island prohibits abortions at its six hospitals, forcing women there to travel to New Brunswick or Nova Scotia\n",
      "Abortion-rights groups say the situation would improve if the RU-486 abortion pill were available in Canada\n",
      "No drug company has applied for permission to market the pill, either fearing boycotts or doubting its profitability\n",
      "The government has been urged to make a public appeal to drug companies, but the health department says this can't be done\n",
      "``It would be a conflict of interest,'' said Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman\n",
      "``As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge an application impartially.'' Abortion was illegal in Canada until 1988\n",
      "Now there is no abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortions are performed annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters of Canadians favor pro-choice policies\n",
      "Yet public support doesn't spare doctors from fear\n",
      "Dr\n",
      "Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts to overturn the old abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed in 1993, says he and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom as they reluctantly increase security measures\n",
      "``Unfortunately, doctors who are committed to providing these services will have to accept a certain diminishment of their enjoyment of life,'' he said\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone who knew Dr\n",
      "Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, most people\n",
      "There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage cans at his home and growled ``murderer'' as they passed him in the grocery store aisle\n",
      "Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients as they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby killer\n",
      "Outside the clinic where he performed abortions two days a week, pickets shouted epithets like ``pig'' to his face\n",
      "Slepian, an obstetrician and gynecologist by training and an abortion doctor by principle, rarely acknowledged the strain\n",
      "He might crack an occasional joke at the expense of the protesters who shadowed him at work and on weekends\n",
      "Then he would do something unexpected, like invite an anti-abortion leader to breakfast or stop and chat with a familiar demonstrator outside the clinic\n",
      "So when he was killed Oct\n",
      "23 by a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York state and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence\n",
      "He had predicted as much himself\n",
      "Instead, they wondered, once again, that he persisted in that work, long after other Buffalo doctors had surrendered to the pressure of abortion opponents\n",
      "``He was an incredibly fatalistic person who thought that if your number's up, it's up, and there is nothing you can do about it,'' said H\n",
      "Amanda Robb, the doctor's 32-year-old niece\n",
      "``And he was incredibly stubborn\n",
      "He said that women had a right to comprehensive health care and since he was a women's doctor, he was going to provide it for them.'' Slepian is the third doctor to be killed in the last five years in bombings and shootings that have killed 7 people and wounded 17 at abortion clinics around the nation\n",
      "To his tormentors, he was simply an abortion doctor\n",
      "To members of the abortion rights movement, he was a martyr for their cause\n",
      "But Slepian was far from either\n",
      "In interviews with friends and family members, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative who advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a shy man who had rare flashes of anger, a doctor who performed abortions but had no more patience for women who had multiple abortions than for women who had multiple children they did not want or could not support\n",
      "He was killed because he performed a medical procedure that has become emotional and politicized\n",
      "Yet there is nothing in his life to suggest he was a crusader in either politics or medicine\n",
      "Rather, he was an obstinate, unassuming man who did a remarkable thing\n",
      "Out of contrariness and out of conscience, say those who knew him, he refused to allow anyone to dictate what kind of doctor he should be, and for that, he paid with his life\n",
      "The clues to Slepian's flinty brand of commitment lie, in part, in his upbringing\n",
      "His was a family that took success for granted even as it teetered on the edge of poverty\n",
      "To earn money for medical school, he shoveled muck at a ranch and drove a taxi\n",
      "He made few friends, but those he had were friends for life\n",
      "When their wives were sick, he called repeatedly\n",
      "When they were lonely, he flew to their side\n",
      "Slepian, who was known as Bart, used to tell people that he chose obstetrics because it is a specialty that exposes a doctor to the least suffering, and that he performed abortions because it was legal and the alternatives were so much worse\n",
      "Slepian often expressed exasperation over women who came to him for abortion after abortion\n",
      "``Don't they get it?'' his clinic staff recall him saying more than once\n",
      "He had the same impatience for women like those he remembered from his residency in inner-city Buffalo, who had child after child and no means of support\n",
      "``He had the contempt for that of somebody who had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and made it in the world,'' Ms\n",
      "Robb said\n",
      "He believed that to ban abortions or, just as shameful in his view, to stop teaching young doctors how to perform them, would not correct the human imperfections that he found so irritating\n",
      "``There are 1.5 million abortions performed in this country,'' his niece said, ``and he just felt we're not equipped to handle 1.5 million unwanted children.'' When he was killed, at the age of 52, Bart Slepian owned an imposing red brick home in the quiet suburb of Amherst, complete with a swimming pool with piped-in music and an assortment of the time-saving gadgets he adored\n",
      "Slepian's trajectory to that comfortable doctor's life had been unconventional\n",
      "His grandfather, a Russian Jewish immigrant who started out selling shoelaces from a pushcart in Boston, propelled all five of his sons into Harvard at a time when few Jews met the university's blue-blood standards\n",
      "His father, in turn, decreed that his own three sons would be doctors or earn Ph.D's\n",
      "``We grew up in a home where there was tremendous, tremendous, tremendous respect for education,'' said Serena Robb, Slepian's sister, who is four years older than him\n",
      "``If you got an A, it was OK If you got a B, you got yelled at.'' The family's means did not match its expectations\n",
      "Slepian's father, Philip, had joined his own father's business manufacturing leather soles for shoes\n",
      "Soon after Bart was born in 1946 in Boston, the company failed, so to save money, the father moved his family of six to his in-laws' apartment in McKeesport, Pa., and then to Rochester, N.Y\n",
      "Once settled, Slepian's father set himself up as a freelance writer, crisscrossing the country in his old Studebaker, researching the origins of prominent citizens at the Library of Congress and writing their stories for small-town newspapers\n",
      "He sold articles by the hundreds, and was still writing until his death nine years ago at the age of 93\n",
      "The success that was expected of Bart Slepian did not come easily\n",
      "As a child, he was so shy that he cried when anyone looked at him, his sister recalled\n",
      "An unexceptional student, he went to a local community college before transferring to the University of Denver, where he majored in zoology\n",
      "Rejected by medical schools in the United States _ the fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied one year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico\n",
      "His friends remember him as funny and obstinate, a thin young man with glasses and a receding hairline who beat all comers at arm-wrestling and pool\n",
      "``Bart had certain beliefs, strongly held,'' said Richard Schwarz, an old classmate who is an internist on Long Island\n",
      "``He always said you shouldn't sit around whining about things,'' Schwarz said\n",
      "``He would say, `Go after what's yours and what's right.''' Bart Slepian's determination surfaced in quirky ways\n",
      "He once insisted on going to the top of the World Trade Center, despite a crippling fear of heights\n",
      "To get to the window, he crawled, inch by inch\n",
      "``I said, `You don't have to do this,' '' recalled Schwarz, who was with him at the time\n",
      "``And he said, `I want to do it.' Bart made it count\n",
      "He felt alive.'' Forced to drop out of school every few semesters to work, he lived in Reno with his sister Serena, a widow who was struggling to take care of two young daughters\n",
      "She worked as a waitress and a blackjack dealer, sharing her tips with him while he drove a cab, cleaned barns at a ranch and worked as a laboratory assistant at the local Veterans Administration hospital\n",
      "After graduation, he moved to Buffalo for his medical residency\n",
      "There he married Lynne Breitbart, a registered nurse 10 years his junior, and scraped together the money to buy an obstetrics practice from a doctor who was about to retire\n",
      "He had a soothing, unhurried manner\n",
      "When a patient of his, Patti Durlak, was diagnosed with diabetes, Slepian referred her to a specialist but called every few days for months to help her overcome a fear of the needles she had to use for her insulin injections\n",

      "In one notorious 1991 incident recorded on videotape, the Rev\n",
      "Paul Schenck, one of the fieriest of Buffalo's anti-abortion leaders, threw himself in front of the doctor's car as he pulled into the clinic driveway\n",
      "Slepian parked on the street\n",
      "As he pushed his way through the crowd of chanting demonstrators, Schenck cupped his hands around his mouth and lunged, shouting, ``Slepian, you pig!'' Slepian's attempts to separate the abortion conflict from his private life were futile\n",
      "The protests followed him home and the man who had been so bashful as a boy found himself, uncomfortably, at the center of controversy and attention\n",
      "Once, he showed his anger\n",
      "In 1988, when demonstrators jeered at him from the sidewalk in front of his home as he opened Hanukkah presents with his children, the doctor came out brandishing a baseball bat\n",
      "He denied he hurt anyone, but a town judge ordered him to repair one protester's smashed van window and pay a portion of another's medical bills\n",
      "The outburst surprised his family and friends\n",
      "It was not Slepian's style to make a public fuss, much less acknowledge the stress of being taunted by protesters\n",
      "``Stress?'' his oldest brother Paul responded gruffly when asked about the doctor's mood\n",
      "``I never heard the word used in my family, except as an engineering term\n",
      "He said it was a nuisance.'' Mrs\n",
      "Slepian did not respond to requests for an interview\n",
      "She expressed rage to The Buffalo News shortly after the shooting\n",
      "She said that whoever had killed her husband deserved the death penalty and that she would be happy to administer the lethal injection herself\n",
      "She also spoke out after Schenck's brother, Robert, another anti-abortion leader who frequently confronted Slepian, sent a bouquet of flowers\n",
      "Mrs\n",
      "Slepian denounced him as ``a hypocrite.'' After the confrontation in 1988, Slepian turned to civil harassment lawsuits, letters and levity to deal with the protesters\n",
      "In 1993, when a man active in the anti-abortion effort was arrested for rifling through the doctor's garbage cans at home, Slepian tried to treat the incident lightly\n",
      "``They hopefully got the bags full of dirty diapers,'' he joked\n",
      "He tried to engage his critics through the local newspaper\n",
      "He told The Buffalo News that abortion protesters should turn their energies to helping women avoid unwanted pregnancies through birth control and counseling\n",
      "In a letter to the editor he warned that by repeatedly calling him a murderer, his critics were inciting violence\n",
      "Slepian accepted that opponents of abortion acted out of moral conviction, his friends said, but resented the personal attacks\n",
      "``He thought it tended to demonize and dehumanize him and increased the danger,'' said his lawyer, Glenn Edward Murray\n",
      "So Slepian took a step that few of the nation's beleaguered abortion clinic doctors dared\n",
      "He insisted that if he tried hard enough, he might cut through the venom\n",
      "To the dismay of the staff members who feared for his safety, Slepian began about a year ago to stop and chat with protesters he recognized outside the Womenservices abortion clinic in Buffalo, where he worked two days a week\n",
      "He surprised a gathering of protesters who were preparing for what they euphemistically called a ``house call,'' or demonstration at the doctor's home, and invited the protest's organizer, the Rev\n",
      "Robert Behn, to breakfast\n",
      "Their hourlong conversation the next morning was inconclusive, Behn said, dismissing Slepian's gesture as an ``attempt to get people to like him.'' He asked Slepian how performing abortions affected him spiritually\n",
      "In response, he recalled, the doctor said, ``I'm fine spiritually.'' Slepian, meanwhile, focused more on time away from home with his family\n",
      "He planned to take a cruise next spring\n",
      "He bought a time-share apartment near Disney World in Florida\n",
      "``He had so many plans,'' said Ellen Fink, a close friend of the couple for 15 years\n",
      "``He wasn't done\n",
      "He wasn't done living yet.'' Still, sometimes during the most casual conversations, a shadow would appear\n",
      "When his wife gave him a gray African parrot for a birthday gift, Slepian joked that the bird would probably outlive him so he would teach it his eulogy\n",
      "``He would talk about the funeral he wanted,'' Mrs\n",
      "Fink said\n",
      "``He said he didn't have a lot of friends and wanted all of them to come in separate cars, one in each car, so he'd have a long procession.'' In the week before his death, Slepian had reasons to be preoccupied with thoughts of mortality\n",
      "A medical checkup had revealed a blockage of his heart, Mrs\n",
      "Fink said, recounting a conversation with Mrs\n",
      "Slepian the day of the slaying\n",
      "A blockage is a sign of probable coronary artery disease\n",
      "He was to have more tests the following week\n",
      "``I said, `Lynne, just relax, it's going to be OK,''' Mrs\n",
      "Fink recalled\n",
      "That same day, the National Abortion Federation sent a fax to the Womenservices clinic warning of a pattern of sniper attacks on abortion doctors that occurred in early November\n",
      "Marilynne Buckham, the clinic director, sent it to Slepian\n",
      "``He definitely took it seriously,'' she recalled\n",
      "Typically, the doctor did not share any concerns he might have felt\n",
      "``It was a normal day,'' said Tammi Latini, his office assistant\n",
      "``We were horsing around.' That evening, the Slepians went to synagogue to mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Slepian's father\n",
      "Shortly after they returned home, a sniper's bullet smashed through the kitchen window, killing Slepian as he chatted with his wife and sons\n",
      "The protesters returned to the clinic five days later, the first day it reopened\n",
      "Mrs\n",
      "Buckham, the director, said Slepian would not have been surprised\n",
      "They have their routine\n",
      "So did he\n",
      "``He never wanted a day to end on a bad note,'' she said\n",
      "``At the end of the day, I would always say, `Thank you for coming.' And he would always turn with a stupid grin and say, `Thanks for having me.''' \n",

      "Five days after the shooting, the Spectator received a package containing an antiabortion flier with biographical information about Slepian, including a photograph of him that had been crossed out\n",
      "``It certainly causes us to be more interested than ever in speaking to Kopp,'' said Inspector Keith McKaskill of the Winnipeg Police Department, a spokesman for the Canada-United States task force investigating the five shootings\n",
      "Even as they searched for Kopp, federal officials were also looking into three letters that were received Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organizations in Buffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago\n",
      "Those letters, saying they contained the deadly anthrax bacteria, came 10 days after eight similar threats to clinics that provide abortions\n",
      "All the letters appear to be hoaxes, and it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five shootings\n",

      "The slaying of Dr\n",
      "Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it has not eliminated women's access to abortion\n",
      "That is because the availability of abortion in the Buffalo area, as in much of the United States, is a complex reality, one affected by class and education, medical training and the personal convictions of individual doctors\n",
      "Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent women here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy can usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologists, or if a gynecologist has a personal objection to the procedure, through a referral to a colleague\n",
      "Women who are poor, young or uneducated and have no such regular relationships with doctors have to rely on specialized clinics like the one Slepian worked in, or on hospitals\n",
      "It is this group _ for whom unplanned pregnancies are far more common than for prosperous women _ that faces a shrinking universe of possibilities as a result of the fear set off by Slepian's killing and the slayings of five other doctors and clinic workers since 1993, medical experts said\n",

      "They now number roughly 1.5 million a year, according to reports by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according to the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion group, which calculates its estimate partly from the Guttmacher figures\n",
      "The number of providers who identify themselves as performing abortions as part of their practice is diminishing as well\n",
      "A 1994 Guttmacher study, the last one published, found that the number had decreased 18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908\n",
      "Moreover, the study said, only 12 percent of the nation's residency programs routinely offer training in abortions during the first trimester, though many do offer elective courses\n",
      "Laura Echevarria, director of media relations for the National Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treating miscarriages that are similar to those used for performing abortions\n",
      "Only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like New York does the availability of abortions continue at a steady level, experts say, though even in these locales there is concern about the decreasing number of young doctors who emerge from residencies fully trained in performing abortions\n",
      "The Guttmacher Institute, which keeps the nation's most precise statistics, said that in 1992, the last year for which it has figures, there were 142,410 abortions in New York that were done by just 151 providers, including 61 hospitals and 44 clinics\n",
      "Still, that provider figure greatly understates the number of private doctors who perform them in their offices, medical experts say\n",
      "``Many obstetricians and gynecologists in Manhattan provide abortions as part of their palette of services, and have for many years,'' said Dr\n",
      "Richard Hausknecht, the medical director of Planned Parenthood\n",
      "``Rich and middle-class women have always had access to abortions, and they always will.'' The major threat to availability in the city is less a result of anti-abortion violence than of medical training\n",
      "``The bottom line is that we're facing an impending shortage of physicians who are adequately trained and willing to do the procedures,'' said Dr\n",
      "John Choate, chairman of the New York State division of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n",
      "But the lack of training programs is also a result of political pressures on hospitals and universities by antagonists of abortion and the same climate of fear\n",
      "``Physicians tend to lie low,'' Choate said\n",
      "``They don't publicize the fact that they do them\n",
      "If they do them, they do it quietly out of fear for their practice and for their lives.'' One development on the horizon that is expected to change the outlook for abortions substantially is final federal approval, expected next year, of the RU-486 pill, the drug that ends an early pregnancy without the need for surgery\n",
      "When the pill was introduced in France and in Edinburgh, Scotland, Hausknecht said, the number of surgical abortions plummeted\n",

      "They are still guilty of interfering with women's access.'' But Mary Quinn, a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who also offers her home to protesters, sees matters in a differing light\n",

      "He was later convicted and served two and a half months in prison\n",

      "``He was always in a good mood,'' Kenny said\n",
      "``He never did anything violent at all.'' Both Kopp and Weslin have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests\n",

      "Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian\n",
      "They are mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their movement\n",
      "In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering other possible explanations for the killing\n",
      "Some say they believe that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a personal experience with abortion\n",
      "Others wondered whether the shooter had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him from performing more abortions\n",
      "The Lambs also wonder whether abortionist opponents are being blamed for a shooting committed by a disgruntled patient\n",

      "Fredericks said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who provides abortions was someone ``who had snapped, perhaps because of the importance of the situation.'' Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder their efforts\n",

      "``What I saw was the end of life,'' she said\n",

      "We'd rather be loved, but more than that we'd like to be effective.'' MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICS AND SAFETY NETS On a steaming January day, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's top official, slipped into Jakarta to the private residence of President Suharto and sat down for a four-hour meeting to tick off, line by line, the huge reforms Indonesia would have to implement in return for tens of billions of dollars in emergency aid\n",
      "Two previous deals had collapsed when Suharto ignored the fund's conditions, so Camdessus insisted that he strike a deal directly with Suharto, then Asia's longest-serving leader\n",
      "It was a meeting of men who knew different worlds of power politics: Suharto rose as a general in central Java, and Camdessus had detonated mines in Algeria for the French army before entering the French Treasury on his way to becoming head of France's central bank\n",
      "``It was all there,'' a senior IMF official recalled\n",
      "``He was told he had to dismantle the national airplane project, the clove monopoly, all the distribution monopolies.'' At one point, Camdessus looked at the impassive Suharto and said, ``You see what this means for your family,'' a reference to their vast investments in the country's key industries\n",
      "``He said, `I called in my children, and they all understand.''' But within months, that exchange in Jakarta came to symbolize the IMF's twin troubles: Its inability to understand and reckon with the national politics of countries in need of radical reform, and its focus on economic stabilization rather than the social costs of its actions\n",
      "Suharto had no intention of fulfilling the agreement\n",
      "It was, one of his former Cabinet members said, ``a delaying move that was obvious to everyone except Camdessus.'' Perhaps one reason why the IMF sometimes appears tone-deaf is that its senior staff is almost entirely composed of Ph.D\n",
      "economists\n",
      "There are few officials with deep experience in international politics, much less the complexities of Javanese culture that were at work in Indonesia\n",
      "Historically, experts in politics and security have gravitated to the United Nations, development experts to the World Bank, and economists to the IMF _ creating dangerous gaps in a crisis like this one\n",
      "As a result, the fund had only a rudimentary understanding of what would happen if its demands were met and all Indonesia's state monopolies were quickly dissolved\n",
      "While that system lined the pockets of the Suhartos and their friends, it also distributed food, gasoline and other staples to a country that stretches for 3,000 miles over thousands of islands\n",
      "To help balance the budget, the fund demanded a quick end to expensive subsidies that keep the price of food and gasoline artificially low\n",
      "But that, combined with the huge currency devaluation that sparked the crisis, resulted in high prices and shortages that fueled riots that continue to this day, as millions of Indonesians lose their jobs\n",
      "The IMF _ unintentionally, its officials insist _ also sped Suharto's resignation, insisting on the elimination of ``crony capitalism,'' code words for removing the Suharto family from the center of the economy\n",
      "Ultimately, that may prove to be Indonesia's salvation, if the new government can contain the rioting against the ethnic Chinese minority _ whose money is desperately needed to save the country's fast-shrinking economy\n",
      "``It is worth noting,'' Fischer said this week, ``that our programs in Asia _ in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand _ only took hold after there was a change in government.'' Nonetheless, the Indonesia experience has revived the argument that the IMF is so focused on stabilizing banks and currencies, on preventing capital flight and freeing up markets, that it is blind to the social costs of its actions\n",
      "Among the toughest critics has been its sister institution, the World Bank, whose main charge is alleviating poverty\n",
      "``You've seen the tension almost every day,'' one senior World Bank official said recently\n",
      "The bank has gone to extraordinary lengths in recent months to differentiate its role from that of the fund, and to announce a tripling of aid to the poorest in the countries hit by the economic chaos\n",
      "Even U.N\n",
      "Secretary General Kofi Annan has joined the argument, warning in a speech at Harvard recently that ``if globalization is to succeed, it must succeed for poor and rich alike\n",
      "It must deliver rights no less than riches\n",
      "It must be harnessed to the cause not of capital alone, but of development and prosperity for the poorest of the world.'' IMF officials say they are changing strategies when they see they are exacting too great a social cost\n",
      "``It's a very difficult formula to get exactly right,'' Fischer said in August, as Russia was teetering and the IMF was sending in $4.8 billion in aid that was rapidly wasted\n",
      "``You need enough discipline to send the right message to the markets and keep investors from fleeing\n",
      "But you need enough leeway to keep people from suffering more than they otherwise would.'' In recent months, he noted, the IMF has allowed more spending to sustain subsidies for basic goods for longer periods in Indonesia, Korea and elsewhere\n",
      "``There is a new flexibility at the IMF'' a senior Indonesian official concluded recently\n",
      "``It is a lot better.'' A U.S\n",
      "PAWN, OR A RUNAWAY AGENCY? The Clinton administration admits that the IMF has many failings, many of them on display this year\n",
      "But it insists that the world has gone through global financial crises without an IMF once before in this century _ and the result was the 1930s\n",
      "``I have no doubt the situation over the past year would have been much worse _ with greater devaluations, more defaults, more contagion, and greater trade dislocations _ without the program agreed with the IMF and the finance it has provided,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Congress last week\n",
      "Many Republicans and some Democrats are unconvinced\n",
      "Even though the Senate has overwhelmingly approved an $18 billion contribution to the fund to help it fight new crises, the House defeated that measure two weeks ago\n",
      "The fund's last hope of getting the money, which will free up nearly $100 billion in contributions from other nations waiting for the United States to act, will come when the House and Senate try to resolve their budget differences in a conference committee in the next 10 days\n",
      "A rejection, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin insists, would send a message around the world that the United States is turning its back on the one institution charged with restoring economic stability\n",
      "Everywhere else in the world, though, politicians and businessmen insist that one of the biggest problems with the IMF is that, contrary to the view of Congress, it acts as the U.S\n",
      "Treasury's lap dog\n",
      "Ask in Jakarta or Moscow, and the response is the same: The IMF never ventures far without looking back for the approving nod of its master\n",
      "When the United States weighs in, however, is when the IMF is called on to rescue a country in deep trouble\n",
      "Only then does the IMF _ and the U.S\n",
      "Treasury _ have the leverage to extract commitments in return for billions in aid\n",
      "In theory, the U.S\n",
      "influence is limited: It has an 18.5 percent vote in the fund\n",
      "Germany, Japan, France and Britain have about 5 percent each\n",
      "But in practice the United States usually gets its way, exercising its influence behind the scenes, often in interactions between Fischer and Summers\n",
      "The two met when Fischer was on the MIT faculty and Summers was a graduate student taking one of his classes, later becoming a colleague at MIT\n",
      "Each served as chief economist of the World Bank\n",
      "It was Summers who was instrumental in placing Fischer in the fund's no\n",
      "2 job, and these days they talk constantly\n",
      "``It's usually a warm relationship,'' Fischer said this summer\n",
      "``Remember, this is a job where you cannot turn to outsiders for advice _ you can't call the chief economist at a Wall Street firm, or even many of your academic friends, because so many of the issues are confidential.'' The Treasury's relations with Camdessus are often more strained as he plays the role of world diplomat, traveling the globe and trying to coax along political leaders\n",
      "The tensions were obvious from the start of the Asia crisis\n",
      "The fund made little secret of its displeasure that the United States was not offering direct aid to Thailand, a major U.S\n",
      "ally, as a sign of support and confidence\n",
      "Mindful of the backlash in Congress when Mexico was bailed out with U.S\n",
      "money, that was the last thing the Treasury planned to do\n",
      "Summers, in turn, thought the fund was not forcing the Thais to implement its reform commitments rigorously enough or disclose their true financial picture\n",
      "Within the U.S\n",
      "government there was other dissension: The State and Defense Departments felt the United States should do more for Thailand, but backed off when the Treasury asked if they would like to pony up some aid out of their own budgets\n",
      "There were other conflicts\n",
      "When Japan used the last IMF meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion ``Asia Fund'' _ one that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed conditions than the IMF does\n",
      "Rubin called up Camdessus at breakfast one morning and told him that the Japanese proposal would undercut the IMF's authority\n",
      "``We've just had a dispute with Michel,'' Rubin reported to his aides as he returned to his orange juice and croissant\n",
      "One of them shot back: ``And it's only 8 a.m.'' Camdessus backed down at Rubin's insistence and walked away from money that Asia could have used\n",
      "Japan says it will be back with a similar proposal this weekend, this time for a $30 billion fund\n",
      "Camdessus has also rankled U.S\n",
      "officials with statements that amounted to cheerleading to reassure the markets _ sometimes in the face of the facts\n",
      "In June, with Russia on its way to collapse, Camdessus declared that ``contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining'' about the slow collapse of Russia's economy, ``this is not a crisis\n",
      "This is not a major development.'' The bailouts of Russia and South Korea were prime examples of how Washington muscles into the IMF's turf as soon as major U.S\n",
      "strategic interests are involved\n",
      "Last Christmas, as South Korea slipped within days of running out of hard currency to pay its debts in December, it sent a secret envoy, Kim Kihwan, to work out a rescue package\n",
      "``I didn't bother going to the IMF,'' Kim recalled recently\n",
      "``I called Summers' office at the Treasury from my home in Seoul, flew to Washington and went directly there\n",
      "I knew that was how this would get done.'' Within days the Treasury dispatched David Lipton, its most experienced veteran of emergency bailouts, who is leaving his post as undersecretary for international affairs this month, to shadow the IMF staff's negotiations with the government in Seoul\n",
      "Fischer was displeased\n",
      "``To make a negotiation effective, it has to be clear who has the authority to do the negotiating,'' he said\n",
      "WHO LOST RUSSIA? The pattern was repeated this summer, when the United States raced to put together a $17 billion package for Russia\n",
      "The IMF's staff in Moscow declared that Russia needed no money at all _ it just needed to enact policies that would restore confidence in investors\n",
      "The Americans and Germans came to a different conclusion\n",
      "Soon after, U.S\n",
      "officials gathered in the White House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the IMF to come up with emergency money\n",
      "So the fund began assembling a last-ditch program to prop up a country that had resisted its reform plans for seven years\n",
      "Camdessus, though, was still hesitant, questioning whether the IMF should risk its scarce resources in Russia\n",
      "``We had to pull Michel along,'' a senior Treasury official recalled\n",
      "As it turned out, Camdessus' instincts were right while the approach championed by Rubin and Summers proved disastrously wrong\n",
      "The first installment of that payment _ $4.8 billion _ was wasted, propping up the currency long enough, in the words of one IMF official, ``to let the oligarchs get their money out of the country.'' Then Yeltsin reversed his commitments, let the ruble devalue anyway, began printing money with abandon and fired virtually every reformer in his government _ resulting in a collapse of the IMF agreements and the indefinite suspension of its aid program\n",
      "Now, inside the IMF and on Capitol Hill, there are recriminations over ``who lost Russia.'' Publicly, Fischer argues that ``there are no apologies owed for what we attempted in Russia.'' But some IMF officials complain privately that they let Rubin and Summers run roughshod over them, striking a deal that fell apart within weeks as the Russian parliament rebelled and Yeltsin backed away from his commitments\n",
      "Summers responds that the United States ``took a calculated risk'' because ``it was vastly better that Russia succeed than not succeed.'' The Russian collapse touched off new rounds of economic contagion, with investors fleeing Latin America, and triggering huge losses in hedge funds like Long Term Capital, the Greenwich, Conn., investment firm that needed to be rescued by Wall Street powerhouses whose money it had invested\n",
      "``Russia was a turning point,'' said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs  Co\n",
      "``It made the world realize that some countries can fail, even if the IMF and the Treasury intercede\n",

While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when he was foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key issues with Washington, she had harsh words of warning for him\n",
      "``Our initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in has not been particularly positive,'' she said, adding, ``The question now is whether that cooperation can continue.'' The United States must keep up its aid to Russia but is adjusting it to promote the building of democracy and student exchanges as well as arms control, Albright said\n",
      "Washington does not favor more direct aid\n",
      "``More big bailouts are not by themselves going to restore investor confidence in Russia,'' she said\n",
      "``In the long run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment.'' Albright sharply criticized as self-defeating the ``many voices in Russia who want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction with America and our allies from one of partnership to one of assertiveness, opposition and defiance for its own stake.'' Russia could not stand alone in the world, she said, and the United States' ability ``to help Russians help themselves will go from being merely very, very difficult to being absolutely impossible.'' At the same time, she said, Washington would not ``assume the worst, for there are still plenty of people in Russia who will fight against turning back the clock.'' And she urged the world _ and American critics _ to ``be patient with the workings of the democratic process in Russia'' and ``not start each day by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin,'' a census that American officials themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin dismissed the previous government\n",
      "While Moscow may continue to oppose any NATO use of force against Serbian forces in the southern province of Kosovo, Albright said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless\n",

      "The writer of the document warned that the followers of bin Laden, whom he referred to as ``the sheik,'' had ``become America's primary target.'' He said his comrades in East Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.'' ``They know that since Kenya was the main gateway for those members, there must be a center in Kenya,'' he wrote, concluding: ``We are really in danger.'' The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants\n",

      "What the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in the world.'' Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Group, said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration to revise its China policy, which he described as ``almost entirely'' driven by the administration's desire to encourage trade\n",
      "He said that while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights situation in China over the last year _ notably, China's agreement to sign international treaties on civil and economic rights _ the overall picture was bleak\n",
      "``On balance,'' he said, ``any progress China has made by allowing greater openness may have been canceled out by a more repressive attitude.'' Human Rights Watch, the largest American-based human rights group, called on the administration to consider postponing or canceling a planned visit to China early next year by Commerce Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation as a protest over the prison sentences\n",

      "Peter Rodman, a former Nixon and Reagan administration official now at the Nixon Center in Washington, said that ``the United States cannot control the evolution of a society as complex as China's.'' He said the harsh prison sentences given out Monday to the dissidents were to be expected, especially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge the Communists\n",
      "``The pattern of this regime is that every once in a while, they ease up a bit and somebody goes too far and there's a crisis,'' he said\n",

      "After a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 years for ``subversion of state power.'' Xu's alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to Communist rule in interviews with foreign journalists, calling for independent labor unions and, prosecutors said, accepting $500 from a dissident abroad\n",
      "He was defended by a lawyer who was appointed by the court just four days ago and met his client only once\n",

      "Even in its newly musclebound form, America Online remains dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen\n",

      "With its proposed purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., AOL, the nation's largest dial-up online service with more than 14 million subscribers, hopes to take a significant step toward that ambitious goal\n",
      "If the $4 billion deal is completed _ the companies had not reached a final agreement as of Monday night _ AOL would acquire a leading Internet brand and enlarge its wired audience by absorbing the millions who regularly visit Netscape's popular NetCenter site on the World Wide Web\n",

      "Moore, president of Geopartners Inc., a consulting firm\n",
      "``America Online is assembling the kind of audience numbers that will convince people the Internet is becoming a mainstream media.'' In the new media business, as in traditional media like television or newspapers, eyeballs translate into advertising revenue\n",
      "But what really intrigues media executives and consumer marketers about the new media _ news, entertainment and services rendered in computer code _ is that it is inherently a two-way medium with which people can interact with the tap of a key or the click of a mouse button The interaction that advertisers and marketers want to see, of course, is buying\n",
      "And it is the potential for exploiting an instant, direct connection to consumers that has fueled all the recent optimism about electronic commerce\n",
      "Today, companies are selling everything from books to baby clothes over the Internet\n",

      "Microsoft is expected to be a formidable competitor in the media-and-commerce business\n",
      "It has no shortage of bright people and it has more money than any rival\n",
      "Besides deep pockets, Microsoft has the built-in advantage in any computer-based medium because its Windows operating system runs more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today\n",
      "Its control of the Windows desktop gives it the most valuable piece of commercial real estate in the information age\n",
      "In theory, at least, owning that desktop screen should help Microsoft steer consumers to its online offerings _ an issue that is key to the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft\n",
      "But so far, Microsoft has started slowly in the fields of Internet media and electronic commerce\n",
      "``Microsoft may want to, but it does not dominate these new markets,'' said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a research firm\n",
      "``America Online recognizes that the big opportunity is in these emerging growth businesses like electronic commerce instead of trying to take Microsoft on head-on.'' Still, if the Netscape deal is completed, AOL will also find itself in the software business in a way it has never been in the past\n",
      "Netscape is known as the pioneer in the commercial development of software used to navigate the World Wide Web\n",
      "Microsoft saw the browser software as a direct threat to its industry dominance and pursued that market aggressively, bundling its own browser with its Windows and giving it away free _ tactics that have been challenged by the government\n",
      "But Netscape no longer generates revenues from its browser, which it now also distributes for free, but from the sale of heavy-duty software sold to corporations\n",
      "Much of this software is used as the technological ``back office'' for electronic commerce _ used in building Web sites and processing transactions\n",
      "A surprising element in the proposed deal is that AOL intends to hold onto Netscape's corporate software business instead of selling it off to an established software company\n",
      "``America Online just doesn't have credibility in that market,'' observed Michael A\n",
      "Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management\n",
      "Executives close to AOL explain the decision as the need to provide full-line offerings for electronic commerce, from corporate Web site to the computer screens of consumers\n",
      "But AOL has decided it needs help to preserve and strengthen Netscape's corporate software business\n",
      "To do that, it has brought in Sun Microsystems Inc\n",
      "in a side deal, which has complicated the transaction considerably\n",
      "AOL, according to executives close to the proposed deal, will own Netscape, but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun\n",
      "As part of the deal, AOL will agree to purchase about $300 million worth of Sun's computers for its service, while Sun will apparently agree to purchase sizeable amounts of Netscape software, which Sun's sales force must sell\n",
      "Still, AOL and Sun have a longer-term objective as well _ one that promises to place them in more direct conflict with Microsoft\n",
      "For nearly a year, William J\n",
      "Raduchel, Sun's chief strategist, has been working closely with AOL, according to Sun executives\n",
      "A former Harvard economics professor who taught Scott McNealy, the Sun chairman, Raduchel has focused on Sun's Internet programming technologies, called Java and Jini, both of which are seen as potential threats to Microsoft's dominance\n",
      "By combining Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful consumer brand, the Sun executives say, there is the potential for a kind end-run around Microsoft's grip on desktop computing\n",
      "In its research laboratories, Sun has been working on a stripped-down network computer _ a simple-to-use information appliance, which could cost as little as $200 or be given away as part of a subscription service\n",
      "The concept is that AOL's Internet media and electronic commerce services could be delivered to many more homes than today because many people still shun the expense and difficulty of using a personal computer\n",
      "The appliance would be mainly a receiver and screen, with most of the computing power residing on vast central computers serving up information as users request by tapping a few buttons\n",
      "Sun's technological specialty is this kind of centralized ``network'' computing\n",
      "If the long-term AOL-Sun vision ever materialized _ certainly a three-to-five year bet, at the least _ it could give both companies a boost and technological independence from Microsoft\n",

      "The Netscape deal, if consummated, would realign three businesses at the forefront of the modern economy _ on-line services, Internet software and electronic commerce\n",
      "It would strengthen two of Microsoft's leading rivals, AOL and Sun Microsystems\n",
      "At the same time, however, it would end the independent existence of Netscape, an Internet software maker once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market\n",
      "Netscape, founded in 1994, has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft\n",
      "Its Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web\n",
      "But Microsoft, responding to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free\n",
      "Eventually, Microsoft's browser technology caught up to Netscape's\n",
      "Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoffs and started distributing Navigator for free as well, as Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market\n",
      "Since then, Netscape has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which to conduct electronic commerce\n",
      "AOL believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's software sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said\n",
      "Among large corporations, Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular operating systems for the powerful computers that run Netscape's server software\n",
      "The much smaller Netscape would be placed under the wing of AOL and Sun Microsystems\n",
      "The three companies had combined revenues of more than $12.4 billion last year\n",

      "Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a recent book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft.'' The impact of the deal, if any, on the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft is uncertain\n",
      "It does appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense _ namely, that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time\n",
      "Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently\n",
      "But the deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect on the current case\n",
      "``No matter how much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power to protect its monopoly,'' said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case\n",
      "Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial\n",
      "And the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the talks\n",
      "Industry analysts suggest that the companies may have been emboldened to take stronger anti-Microsoft steps based partly on the perception that the antitrust case would weaken Microsoft\n",
      "And representatives of Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm regarded as a power broker among Microsoft's rivals, sit on the boards of Netscape, Sun and AOL\n",
      "Still, executives involved in the talks said that the timing of the proposed deal was unrelated to the antitrust trial\n",
      "Nor should it, one person noted, be regarded as ``a single-minded attempt to circle the wagons against Microsoft.'' Indeed, AOL, according to one person close to the talks, plans to keep Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser as the default choice on its on-line service\n",
      "One of the government's allegations in the antitrust suit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape as the main browser for AOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly as a bargaining chip\n",
      "To win the browser deal, Microsoft offered AOL prime real estate on the Windows desktop, the main screen on more than 90 percent of personal computers sold today\n",
      "Staying with Microsoft's browser can be seen as proof that AOL still regards placement on the Windows desktop as crucial, as well as a careful step to avoid undermining one of the allegations in the government's case\n",
      "For AOL, the Netscape purchase would accelerate its evolution toward the Internet\n",
      "At present, its flagship on-line service is a hybrid _ to its own proprietary service, it has added a gateway to the World Wide Web\n",
      "In addition, for consumers who do not subscribe to AOL's dial-up service, it also has its own Web site, aol.com, which attracts about 24 million visitors a month, according to Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge, a market research firm\n",
      "Its big Web site offers a wide range of information, entertainment, Internet chat and e-mail, a leading example of the all-in-one sites that have become known as portals\n",
      "Netscape's Netcenter traffic has slipped a bit in recent months, to under 16 million visitors a month, but it, too, is a major portal\n",
      "Together, they should be a huge player in the intensifying portal battle for viewers and resulting advertising revenues\n",
      "Yahoo is the current leader among portal sites with more than 25 million monthly visitors, while Microsoft's site attracts more than 20 million a month\n",
      "Though known as a new-media company for consumers, AOL is also interested in boosting its electronic commerce business with the Netscape purchase\n",
      "AOL has recently done work with Eastman Kodak, American Greetings and other companies, not only promoting their products to on-line subscribers but also building the Internet infrastructure of software to conduct electronic commerce\n",
      "AOL notes projections like a recent one from Forrester Research Inc., which predicted that worldwide Internet commerce could reach as high as $3.2 trillion by 2003, or 5 percent of global sales\n",
      "Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for Internet commerce software\n",
      "Sun is a corporate software company with a sales force of several thousand\n",
      "As it moves increasingly to Internet technology, AOL should prove an excellent partner for Sun in terms of developing and using Sun's Java, an Internet programming language\n",
      "And while Netscape's browser no longer generates revenue on its own, it is a distribution channel for Java technology\n",
      "Having Netscape's browser safely in the hands of a friendly company is of strategic importance for Sun, since Microsoft owns the alternative in the browser market\n",
      "AOL is expected pay little, if any, premium over Netscape's stock price on Friday, executives close to the deal said, since Netscape shares have more than doubled in the last month\n",
      "In the last week alone, Netscape's stock has jumped about $12, or nearly 45 percent, following reports that it was discussing a possible partnership with AOL\n",
      "The stock closed Friday at $39.1875, up $2.625\n",

      "The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail trial\n",
      "The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages\n",
      "The human testimony often pales next to the e-mail evidence\n",
      "On the stand or in videotaped testimony, the people being questioned shrug, mumble and forget\n",
      "The e-mail is alive with ideas and competitive zeal, punctuated with profanity and exclamation points\n",
      "The second week of the trial ended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show several hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman\n",
      "With a new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc., taking the stand Monday, it is uncertain when the Gates tape will be played\n",
      "The Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft believe that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows Gates saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government alleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet software market\n",
      "The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers an ``opportunity to judge Gates' credibility.'' But the Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes an issue not because of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be compared and contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received\n",
      "The e-mail record, the government insists, shows Gates waist-deep in plotting the anti-competitive deals and bullying tactics that he denies or professes to have never heard of in his taped deposition\n",
      "If his machinations are central to the government's case, why not summon Gates to the trial? ``The government does not need to put Gates on the stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda,'' Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the states, told the court\n",
      "The Microsoft legal team has for months been preparing its e-mail defense\n",
      "First, Microsoft argues, anything that looks damaging is taken out of context\n",
      "``I urge your honor,'' John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, ``to view with considerable skepticism the crazy quilt of e-mail fragments that seem to form the core of the government's case.'' But Microsoft has also mounted an e-mail counterattack, culled from the millions of messages it obtained by subpoena from competitors in pretrial discovery\n",
      "Warden's cross-examination ritual is to present a government witness with an internal e-mail from his company and then pose a declaration as a question\n",
      "These interrogations have two refrains: Isn't it true your company does exactly what you are accusing Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevailed not because it is a predatory monopolist but because of its superior technology? Microsoft is accused of trying to prod companies to stay out of its way\n",
      "So last week, for example, Warden produced e-mail from Stephen Case, the chairman of America Online, suggesting a partnership with Netscape Communications Corp\n",
      "in which both companies would focus on their respective strengths\n",
      "That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to achieve the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described in an earlier e-mail as beating ``the Beast From Redmond that wants to see us both dead'' _ a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash\n",
      "Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication\n",
      "By the 1920s, as typewriters became common, typed memoranda started to be used in court cases\n",
      "From the 1950s through the 1980s, legal experts say, there was an explosion of documentation fueled by the new technologies of electric typewriters, photocopying and fax machines, and then personal computers\n",
      "And e-mail, they add, has played an important role in legal inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the 1980s when e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial\n",
      "But the Microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government antitrust investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail has supplanted the telephone as the most common instrument of communication\n",
      "``E-mail has just revolutionized investigations of this kind,'' one senior Justice Department official said\n",
      "While under investigation, Microsoft has handed over to the government an estimated 30 million documents, mostly e-mail\n",
      "In the trial, the two sides have submitted about 3,000 exhibits, mainly e-mail\n",
      "And in their e-mail, people often communicate more frankly and informally than when writing a letter or a report _ tap it out, punch a button and it's gone into cyberspace\n",
      "But e-mail communication is documentary evidence, which in legal cases provides a rich, contemporaneous record of what people were thinking and planning at the time\n",
      "It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony, so often coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory\n",
      "``The e-mail record certainly makes the I-don't-recall line of response harder to sustain,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution\n",
      "It can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to contradictions in testimony\n",
      "And that is what the government will do in attacking Gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition, taken over three days in August\n",
      "The government offered a glimpse of that strategy on the first day of the trial\n",
      "It showed a few brief clips of a point in the deposition when Gates was asked about a meeting on June 21, 1995, at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide the browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the company, which is its chief rival in that market\n",
      "In the taped deposition, Gates says he recalled being asked by one of his subordinates whether he thought it made sense to invest in Netscape\n",
      "He said that he was asked about it after the June 1995 meeting and replied, ``I didn't see that as something that made sense.'' But in an e-mail on May 31, 1995, Gates urged an alliance with Netscape\n",
      "``We could even pay them money as part of the deal,'' he wrote, ``buying a piece of them or something.'' The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape\n",
      "To be sure, it is what Microsoft did _ not what it said in e-mail communications _ that counts most\n",
      "``But once the e-mail that looks bad gets in the record, you end up doing what Microsoft's lawyers are going to spend much of this trial doing _ trying to explain it away,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading antitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop  Harkrider in New York\n",

      "At the same time, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market\n",
      "Netscape, founded in 1994, has struggled over the last 18 months under an assault from Microsoft\n",
      "Its Navigator was the runaway leader in the market for the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web\n",
      "But Microsoft, responding to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free\n",
      "Earlier this year, Netscape announced layoffs and started distributing Navigator for free as well, as Microsoft steadily gained in the browser market\n",
      "Since then, Netscape has focused mainly on two businesses _ advertising and transaction fees from its Netcenter Web site and selling industrial-strength software to corporations that are building their own Internet sites on which to conduct electronic commerce\n",
      "AOL believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's software sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said\n",

      "It does appear to support a key theme of Microsoft's defense _ namely, that it operates in a fast-moving industry where corporate alliances shift all the time\n",
      "Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently\n",
      "But the deal, government officials insist, should have no direct effect on the current case\n",
      "``No matter how much the alliances shift, it doesn't affect the central fact of Microsoft's monopoly and how it has used and abused its market power to protect its monopoly,'' said David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer in the Microsoft case\n",
      "Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial\n",
      "And the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the talks\n",

      "Microsoft Corp\n",
      "argued in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp\n",
      "by America Online seriously undermined the government's antitrust suit against the software giant\n",
      "``From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the government,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, said Monday morning on the courthouse steps\n",
      "The reasoning behind this assertion, Microsoft says, is that the proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant _ even with all of the illegal and anti-competitive practices alleged in the government's suit\n",
      "But David Boies, the government's lead attorney, said all of that was irrelevant\n",
      "``Whatever the deal ends up being _ if there ends up being a deal _ is not going to remove any of the obstacles that Microsoft has placed in the path of competition in this industry,'' he said\n",
      "Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems\n",
      "After all, about 22 percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America Online\n",
      "And at present AOL uses Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, as the service's default choice\n",
      "In exchange for that, Microsoft places an AOL advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98\n",
      "Lacovara asked the witness whether, once AOL's service contract expires in January, he would ``expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft software.'' Yes, Warren-Boulton responded\n",
      "``It is not at all clear to me that AOL's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed merger with Netscape.'' He noted that America Online officials had said their need to be among the online services featured in Windows forced them to accept Microsoft terms _ establishing Internet Explorer as the default choice\n",
      "Lacovara then asked Warren-Boulton the question that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness _ and Microsoft's larger assertion Monday about the proposed Netscape-AOL deal\n",
      "``Surely this combination,'' he asked, ``tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry?'' Warren-Boulton's answer was probably not the one Lacovara had been after\n",
      "``To the extent that this potential merger is the result of Microsoft's actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions,'' he said, ``it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape, the brightest, newest star.'' Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is to establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a Microsoft operating system\n",
      "That is the foundation under most of the government's case since federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition\n",
      "Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Lacovara tried to make the case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share was ephemeral\n",
      "The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment _ a point of view the company encourages among its employees\n",
      "On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems on the market, and some software companies _ principally Microsoft's greatest rivals _ are writing software for these new systems\n",
      "But Warren-Boulton argued that ``the existence of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not mean in any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power.'' On Monday afternoon, Lacovara made an issue of the success Apple Computer Co\n",
      "is having selling its new iMac computer\n",
      "He entered into evidence an Apple news release issued last month showing, among other things, that 12.5 percent of the people buying Apple's new iMac computer had previously owned a Windows machine\n",

      "But they have been most competitive, Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and carry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web\n",
      "``They say, `Who knows our software better than Netscape?''' Gett said\n",
      "``We help customers decide which platform is best for them.'' But America Online argues that the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun is just what the business needs\n",

      "Tuesday laid out the details of its agreement to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation for $4.2 billion\n",
      "By moving quickly toward what both companies have recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media, America Online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already joined by giants like the Microsoft Corp\n",
      "and the International Business Machines Corp\n",
      "to transform the greater part of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall\n",
      "Part of that vision rests on an alliance with Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated as part of the deal\n",
      "Sun not only brings a cyber-savvy sales force to the effort but, even more importantly, a strong technology partner in developing Netscape's industrial-strength software for running Internet sites\n",
      "Sun is indeed a technology heavyweight\n",
      "It owns the Java programming language specially designed for Internet applications, and Solaris, among the most popular commercial operating systems for the powerful computers that big corporations use to serve up Internet services like the World Wide Web, e-mail and retail transactions\n",
      "It also manufactures a highly respected line of powerful computers based on its own microprocessor chips\n",
      "But for America Online _ and for the big Internet players against which it will compete _ the real potential gold mine lies further down the road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computers but from inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200 each, or maybe included free as part of a subscription service, just as some cellular phones are now\n",
      "Today, being wired remains a comparatively elitist activity _ an estimated 25 percent of American households had access to the Internet last year, and 5 percent of households bought merchandise on line\n",
      "But the executives at America Online and Netscape hope that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the Net is ubiquitous, when people will tap into the World Wide Web from appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television set-top boxes or computers as routinely as they use the telephone today\n",
      "``A new generation of Internet devices to be able to deliver our service anywhere is a key part of what this deal is about in the long run,'' said Stephen M\n",
      "Case, 40, the chairman of America Online\n",
      "For the present, however, the idea is to make America Online, the nation's leading online service, the standard way to get onto the Internet, the executives explained\n",
      "Netscape, the Internet pioneer, is a crucial part of that effort, they said\n",
      "There is no assurance that this vision of the technological future will prove accurate or, even if it does, that the America Online-Netscape combination will lead the way\n",
      "Still, the long-range game plan helps explain what brought America Online and Netscape together\n",
      "And the ability of the companies' executives to sell that vision to Netscape's whiz-kid programmers in particular will determine whether the merger succeeds\n",
      "Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., is likely become a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunters\n",
      "As is the case with any software company, Netscape's key asset is its talented programmers, and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for America Online, which still has a reputation as a middle-brow service catering to online newcomers, known derisively as ``newbies.'' Stock options and other financial incentives will be tailored to try to keep Netscape employees on board\n",
      "``But these people want to change the world, and we've got to be clear that joining with America Online, along with the Sun component, really is a bigger opportunity for us,'' said Marc Andreessen, the 26-year-old cofounder of Netscape who led a team of young programmers from the supercomputing center at the University of Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software company in 1994\n",
      "``This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the next decade,'' Andreessen declared, speaking from a cell phone on a streetcorner in Palo Alto, Calif\n",
      "For his part, Andreessen, a Netscape executive vice president, will become Netscape's chief technology officer for the next three or four months, until the merger is completed\n",
      "His new job at America Online has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be chief technology officer of the combined company as well, an America Online executive said\n",
      "Already, according to one Netscape board member, Andreessen has delivered a 12-page single-spaced memorandum to Case, setting out his view of the technological road map the new company should follow into the future, emphasizing the opportunities for electronic commerce in an environment in which most people are linked to the Internet\n",
      "Netscape, populated with computing sophisticates, and America Online, known as an on-ramp to the Internet for the technologically challenged, seem a corporate odd couple\n",
      "But the two companies, its executives explained, had been evolving toward each other for more than a year\n",
      "In a telephone interview from America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an enterprise that had ``morphed itself'' from a company dependent on sales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web _ and ``in Microsoft's cross-hairs'' _ into a business that relied on advertising and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling software to corporations to handle electronic commerce\n",
      "The Netscape transformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault on its browser business _ a central element in the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft\n",
      "Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard Windows operating system, and gave away the browser for free\n",
      "The government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of anticompetitive practices, while Microsoft maintains the moves were intended mainly to benefit consumers\n",
      "Early this year, after laying off workers and suffering a large loss last year, Netscape announced that it would also distribute its browser for free\n",
      "It seems to have stabilized its business around its new model\n",
      "Netscape announced Tuesday that it earned $2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal quarter, which ended in September\n",
      "Yet America Online has also changed in the last couple of years, moving well beyond its reputation as an online service for beginners\n",
      "It now has an Internet chat service and runs its own all-in-one site on the Web, known as a ``portal,'' which includes e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online shopping\n",
      "``America Online has really changed from a closed online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology company with a diverse set of brands,'' Andreessen said\n",
      "``These two companies have been moving in the same direction, and the fit is a good one.'' \n",
      "North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages with its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday\n",
      "The officials warned against international complacency and hostility toward North Korea as the food crisis stretches on and the isolated communist country shows little willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its ruined economy\n",
      "``Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of the world,'' said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary of disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspecting the aid agency's operations in North Korea\n",
      "She and other Red Cross officials saw further ravages of North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied to only half the capital, Pyongyang, at a time; the elderly looking swollen, a sign of long-term hunger; a generation of children stunted, with 10-year-olds looking like 6-year-olds and 5-year-olds like 2-year-olds\n",
      "Everywhere, from bakeries to government ministries, people were being served noodles and cakes made from soybeans mixed with acorns, grass and herbs, Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg said\n",
      "Heiberg likened the additives to ``cattle food'' and noted that doctors reported a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures\n",
      "``This is really part of the daily life,'' she said\n",
      "``You would not give them to your children or your elderly mother knowing she would get cramps in her stomach and diarrhea unless her stomach was moaning.'' Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, already teetering from the loss of its Soviet bloc trading partners\n",
      "With few goods or money to barter or buy foreign supplies, the country lacks sufficient fertilizer for crops, and fuel and parts for machinery\n",
      "The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting cabbage, the winter's main vegetable\n",
      "The grain harvest is finished and by U.N\n",
      "estimates little improved over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough to meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people\n",
      "As the long, harsh winter begins, doctors confirm and official statistics show widespread malnutrition, tuberculosis on the rise and hunger-weakened patients unable to recover from operations and sickness, Heiberg said\n",
      "Doctors worry that the respiratory illnesses so common in the winter may ``take a toll'' on the weakened population, she said\n",
      "One 10-bed hospital in the countryside was keeping only three patients at a time because it did not have food to care for more, said Heiberg\n",
      "The Red Cross wants to focus its latest dlrs 9 million appeal on getting essential medicines and blankets and warm clothes to North Korea\n",

      "agencies\n",

      "The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers, who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country\n",
      "Among other shocking findings, researchers from the World Food Program, Unicef and the European Union found that, because of long-term food shortages, a staggering 62 percent of children under 7 years old suffer from stunted growth\n",
      "They have discovered that, despite a huge international food aid program over the past three years, severe malnutrition is widespread among toddlers at crucial stages of brain development, suggesting that this generation's physical and mental abilities will not develop normally and that the losses can never be recovered\n",
      "Separately, international medical workers from groups like the Red Cross, have begun to document how the effects of food shortages are being severely compounded by a breakdown in public health services\n",
      "Even basic water purification systems stand idle for lack of essential ingredients like chlorine, Red Cross workers say, leaving vast numbers of people with such severe diarrhea that they are unable to absorb completely what little food they have\n",
      "As the North Korean dictatorship has slowly, often grudgingly, granted increased access to international aid groups in the last six months, an increasingly clear and saddening picture of the hunger haas emerged as a result of the large formal study and informal surveys and observations by foreign aid agencies\n",
      "Past assessments of the magnitude of the disaster in the country of 23 million are considered flawed because they were based on interviews with a small number of North Korean refugees who had fled into China\n",
      "And while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did find was in many ways equally disturbing: A population withering after nearly a decade of chronic hunger, people so weakened by malnutrition that colds and stomach flus quickly turn lethal, the future of a generation irretrievably lost\n",
      "``Now at last we have hard facts _ the situation is very grave,'' said Judith Cheng-Hopkins, regional director for Asia of the World Food Program, which has taken part in the research\n",
      "``To me this is a famine in slow motion\n",
      "People cope year after year, and probably a lot drop off\n",
      "But the totality is very hard to gauge.'' For three weeks this fall, crews led by foreign scientists were finally permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of children, providing by far the most solid data on the crisis\n",
      "They found that 62 percent of children under 7 had stunted growth, a symptom of long-term malnutrition\n",
      "Thirty percent of 1-year-olds suffered from moderate to severe malnutrition\n",
      "This means a high likelihood of impaired mental and physical development, because the nervous system matures dramatically during this essential first year\n",
      "The researchers said that available scientific data suggest that 10 years ago, malnutrition was rare in North Korea\n",
      "``Even if the situation improves, it is unlikely to improve to the degree that the country will fully recover from what we saw,'' said Judit Katona-Apte, a senior program adviser for the World Food Program\n",
      "``People will be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities.'' Likewise, when Red Cross representatives this year tested the water supply at the 840 hospitals and clinics where they operate, they found that not one had water that was suitable for human consumption, said Sten Swedlund, head of the Red Cross delegation in North Korea\n",
      "``But of course they drink it _ they have no choice,'' he said during a recent trip to Beijing\n",
      "``There is a very close relationship between the problems caused by the lack of food and a health sector that's in very bad shape.'' Virtually all the children under 7 who are malnourished also have diarrhea, he said\n",
      "None of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of hunger-related deaths, and the North Koreans have not released relevant figures, although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began\n",
      "But public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case, because most deaths were probably not from quick starvation, but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger, so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal\n",
      "Still, there are some disturbing clues: In one limited study conducted by the World Food Program and other groups last year on 4,000 children hand-picked by the government, 10 percent had a parent who was dead\n",
      "In this fall's independent nutritional survey, 18 teams of experts sent to eight of North Korea's nine provinces looked at 1,800 rural and urban children under seven\n",
      "In addition to finding that 62 percent of children had stunted growth, the teams found that about 16 percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition and were underweight for their height, a sign that they were severely underfed at the time of the study\n",
      "That figure is higher than in any country in East Asia and puts North Korea among the world's worst 10 countries in terms of malnutrition\n",
      "While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as that of India and Bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number in some ways understates the problem\n",
      "In India and Bangladesh, pockets of severe poverty alternate with pockets of relative plenty, while in North Korea the whole country is to some degree underfed\n",
      "``Even in war-torn countries, famine is more in pockets,'' Dr\n",
      "Katona-Apte said\n",
      "``It's hard to think of another country that's been affected in this way.'' The survey results are especially sobering since the researchers studied only children under 7, the group that received nearly all the food donated from abroad\n",
      "After three years of food donations, many foreign aid workers in the country have remarked that children in nurseries and kindergartens are looking better _ but that their older siblings are failing\n",
      "So a month ago, the World Food Program began providing elementary schools with high nutrition biscuits for children aged 7 to 12\n",
      "``We have reason to believe that many people are suffering and that the elderly are a neglected age group that is just getting weaker and weaker,'' Swedlund said\n",
      "There are now more than 100 Westerners living in Pyongyang, the capital city, and many say the long-term hunger is readily apparent there\n",
      "``If you walk down the street in Pyongyang and ask a child how old she is, you are usually off by three years,'' Swedlund said\n",
      "``She may be 7 but she looks just 3 or 4.'' Dr\n",
      "Katona-Apte, a nutrition expert who has worked in Bangladesh and the Sudan, said she was shocked when she first visited a North Korean kindergarten last year\n",
      "``There were these two children sitting at a desk who were obviously severely malnourished _ they were so thin and they had patchy hair,'' she said\n",
      "``And they were just sitting there working\n",
      "This is accepted as normal! They are in school, and they should really be hospitalized or placed in nutritional rehabilitation\n",
      "If you saw them in a refugee camp, you would recommend immediate intervention.'' But with a severely depleted public health and hospital system, that option does not exist, she and others said\n",
      "Many Korean doctors do not know how to diagnose or treat malnutrition; few had seen it before this decade\n",
      "And, in any case, the hospitals lack the food and proper nutritional supplements\n",
      "Swedlund said most hospitals lacked medicines, had no glass to replace broken windows and were ``colder inside than out,'' having received no coal since 1994\n",
      "He said that even in hospitals, sanitation and water purification systems were virtually nonexistent, because the country lacks chlorine for purification and fuel to run water pumps\n",
      "He said that next year, the Red Cross would start to address those problems, spending $3.5 on food for hospital patients and $1 million on water treatment\n",
      "With few other options, vast numbers of North Koreans have resorted to eating ``substitute food,'' hard cakes and noodles made from a mix of nutritional plants, like soybeans and sweet potatoes, combined with indigestible filler, like cornstalks and straw\n",
      "``This now constitutes 40 percent of food intake,'' Swedlund said\n",
      "``It's becoming a regular part of the food basket.'' Doctors in North Korea say many people suffer from stomachaches after eating this partly indigestible material, he said, but added, ``If you're very hungry, it fills your stomach.'' Although the North Koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, the foreign researchers who have worked in North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had long been North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel and fertilizer\n",
      "North Korea is a mountainous country, with less than 20 percent arable land\n",
      "It has been a food importer for decades, mostly from the former Soviet Union, but also from China\n",
      "``The country has to come to grips with the fact that this is part of a structural problem and can't just be blamed on the weather anymore,'' Ms\n",
      "Cheng-Hopkins said\n",
      "Still, she and others praised the normally rigid and secretive government for slowly loosening its restrictions\n",
      "Swedlund said that after three years in the country, the international Red Cross, which collaborates with the North Korean Red Cross, had found officials increasingly responsive and doctors more willing to share medical records and bring up problems\n",
      "Travel is still restricted\n",
      "There are more than 100 counties, home to 30 percent of the population, to which aid groups have no access and where they have therefore refused to provide food or medical supplies\n",
      "Still, the number of counties open to the workers has increased steadily, and freedom to move about has improved\n",
      "Ms\n",
      "Cheng-Hopkins said about half of follow-up inspections were now unannounced, and she noted that the researchers in the nutritional survey were allowed to select villages to visit and enter homes at random\n",
      "Workers from the Red Cross and the World Food Program said they had not observed extreme scenes of people dying of acute starvation and believe that they would have if they were occurring frequently\n",
      "``I have not seen acute starvation like I have seen in Bangladesh,'' Dr\n",
      "Katona-Apte said\n",
      "``But that doesn't mean it can't exist\n",
      "We're still really limited in what we can see.'' Swedlund said it was unlikely that the counties still closed to foreigners were markedly different from the open ones\n",
      "And while some have surmised that the closed counties might harbor pockets of death and devastation, he said he accepted North Korea's explanation that they had been excluded from some areas for national security reasons\n",
      "``One thing I've learned is how important national security issues are to the North Koreans,'' said Swedlund, a retired admiral in the Swedish Navy\n",
      "``And I really think these areas are important from that standpoint,'' he added, going through a map of closed areas and describing what Western intelligence experts know about military installations there\n",
      "He also rejected the notion that the North Korean military is stealing donated food, a charge leveled by the organization Doctors Without Borders, when it angrily pulled out of North Korea last summer to protest the many restrictions on groups working there\n",
      "Now that aid groups say they are starting to get somewhat better cooperation from the North Koreans, they hope to repeat their nutrition survey every 6 to 12 months\n",
      "And they are still analyzing some tantalizing findings: Boys were twice as likely to suffer from stunted growth as girls, and every child whose mother was dead was malnourished\n",
      "``A generation of North Korean children is already scarred for life,'' said Astrid Heiberg, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in an interview in Beijing after a trip to North Korea\n",
      "``We need to continue to mobilize resources to prevent an even greater catastrophe.'' \n",
      "A North Korean man arrived in Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum after escaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said\n",
      "Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a ``third country'' since fleeing North Korea last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said\n",
      "The ministry generally uses the term ``third country'' to avoid naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to return defectors to their homeland\n",
      "The ministry described Kim as a former athlete, but said details of his background and his method of escape from North Korea were not available\n",

      "Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N\n",
      "World Food Program representative said Tuesday\n",
      "Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director\n",
      "``There is enough rice\n",
      "The problem is that people are too poor to access it\n",
      "The problem is poverty,'' Davies said\n",
      "The WFP is currently supporting 1.7 million hungry Cambodians _ about 15 percent of the population _ with food-for-work and direct assistance programs, but Davies said he fears there are still plenty more that are not getting enough to eat every day\n",
      "``The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse in North Korea,'' Davies said\n",
      "``The situation is much worse than most people recognize.'' According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent of Cambodian children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and 20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition\n",
      "By comparison, a similar survey of North Korean children under 7 found that 65 percent are stunted and 16 percent suffer from acute malnutrition\n",
      "Cambodia has produced a rice surplus for export in the last two years and expects another this year, but WFP statistics show that 25 percent of rice-growing areas account for 75 percent of the surplus\n",
      "The majority of Cambodian farmers are not producing enough to keep their families fed and are being increasingly saddled with debts incurred when they run out of reserves before harvest, Davies said\n",
      "Money-lenders in rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid in rice at harvest time, giving many farmers a handicapped start on the next crop season\n",
      "Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of modern child rearing _ problems left mostly unaddressed by under-funded health and education sectors in Cambodia _ have exacerbated the food security problem, Davies said\n",
      "Davies urged the new government to substantially increase annual expenditures on health, education and rural development as a first step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's food crisis\n",
      "``The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation with the malnutrition of children is a crisis,'' Davies said\n",
      "Cambodia typically earmarks about half of its annual budget to defense and security\n",
      "In the 1998 budget, education was allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent\n",
      "Actual disbursements to the three ministries are often only 60 to 70 percent of the budgeted amount as annual revenues fall short of expectations, according to aid workers\n",
      "A 1999 budget draft proposed a reduction of the health ministry's allotment, which caused an outcry in September from health officials and the U.N\n",

      "It was the first ``technically sound survey'' of the problem, UNICEF official Kirsi Madi told reporters\n",
      "The most alarming findings were for toddlers aged one to two, 30 percent of whom were acutely malnourished\n",
      "At that age, ``malnutrition can permanently impair physical and intellectual growth,'' said Judy Cheng-Hopkins, WFP director for the region\n",
      "Children in North Korea's three largest cities _ Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampo _ were better off than their counterparts elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished\n",

      "The founder of South Korea's largest conglomerate plans to visit his native North Korea again next week with a gift of 501 cattle, company officials said Thursday\n",
      "The visit has been delayed a month because of a dispute over 500 cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai group, during a trip to the North in June\n",
      "North Korea claimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul government agents force-fed them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before shipping them to the North\n",
      "Calling the North's claim nonsense, Seoul's Ministry of National Unification ordered Hyundai to check thousands of other cattle being raised at its ranch on the west coast\n",
      "The ministry later acknowledged that lumps of rope were found in the stomachs of some cattle on the ranch, but said the material didn't kill the animals donated to North Korea\n",
      "It blamed the deaths on stress caused by the long shipment by truck to the North\n",
      "The South Korean government said it would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North retracted its accusations\n",
      "On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying that ``the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue of the dead cattle is cleared.'' Kang said the North's letter ``cleared a stumbling block for Hyundai's additional cattle donation.'' During his visit, Chung is expected to reach agreement on details of Hyundai's plan to start sightseeing tours of a scenic mountain in the North\n",

      "Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse, a senior U.N\n",
      "aid official said Saturday\n",
      "North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program said\n",
      "Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for this year are that ``the harvest will not be any better,'' Ngongi told reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea\n",
      "``It may be worse than last year.'' Poor harvests, economic collapse and three years of floods and drought, have produced chronic food shortages in North Korea and left it heavily reliant on foreign aid\n",
      "Fertilizer is lacking, as is fuel to power tractors and farm machinery, meaning most planting and harvesting must be done by hand\n",
      "``Every year it gets worse,'' Ngongi said\n",
      "But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi said the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to which the WFP has access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people who can get aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million\n",
      "Most of those receiving WFP aid are children aged between 6 months and 6 years\n",
      "Ngongi said the government cited security concerns _ notably the lack of a peace treaty with its rival South Korea _ for its decision\n",

      "The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 18, witnesses said, and consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents\n",
      "Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries\n",
      "Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing relatives and friends exhausted with dread to wait for hours at hospitals\n",
      "Some were able to make the wait in rooms off-limits to journalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying and teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they looked for their pals\n",
      "Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday evening\n",
      "``The identification is hard not only because of the burns but also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _ they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Stockholm\n",
      "The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history, shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness\n",

      "The youths were dressed in the same sort of hip-hop garb that the dance-goers had worn, but listened to delicate hymns instead of pounding disco\n",
      "They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously, apparently not knowing how to behave in a church\n",

      "The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history\n",
      "In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas\n",
      "Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and six others died later\n",

      "Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered\n",
      "How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second-story windows? ''As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of the fire, we don't know if it's arson or not,'' Goteborg chief prosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening\n",
      "Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ''50-50'' chance that the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation that authorities had tracked down new clues\n",
      "But Noren later retracted the remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were being excluded\n",
      "As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identified another 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officials said 49 people were released from hospital\n",
      "Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized\n",
      "Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia\n",
      "The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress, delayed the fire squads' response by several minutes\n",
      "Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks\n",

      "He and other officials declined to comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant victims\n",

      "On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the gutted building amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come to grips with catastrophe\n",
      "In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance\n",
      "The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you in heaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading them also had few words\n",

      "His disclosure followed an investigation by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who said Friday at a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs during the last 10 years\n",
      "Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose the ``hypocrisy'' of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton and in October offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had had affairs with members of Congress\n",
      "He said Friday that this larger investigation, to be published perhaps as soon as January, would reveal what he described as indiscretions of several other Republicans\n",
      "He said he had no connection with the White House but that he had hired an investigative firm based in Washington and made up of former employees of the FBI and the CIA\n",
      "He would not confirm whether the firm is Terry Lenzner's Investigative Group Inc., which has done work for the president's private lawyers\n",
      "Livingston was unavailable to reporters Friday\n",
      "He spent some time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of the House chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach Clinton for lying about his own sexual indiscretions\n",
      "Several colleagues knelt at Livingston's knee, whispered to him and patted him on the back\n",
      "He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber, avoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between the House and his regular office across the street\n",
      "The only word out of his aides was that the Navy had awarded contracts worth millions of dollars for ships to be built in his Louisiana district at the Avondale Shipyards\n",
      "During Friday's debate, a handful of Democrats made only oblique allusions to human failures\n",
      "For example, Rep\n",
      "John Lewis, D-Ga., said: ``Let he that has no sin cast the first stone\n",
      "Who, who among us has not sinned?'' But no one said that Livingston's disclosure or the mild Democratic attempts to exploit it would influence their votes on impeachment\n",
      "Rather, on the House floor and in hallway chitchat, Livingston's conduct seemed to be the last thing that either Republicans or Democrats wanted to talk about\n",
      "``Bob Livingston is a first-rate human being,'' said Rep\n",
      "David Obey, D-Wis., who has worked closely and sparred with Livingston on the Appropriations Committee, in an interview\n",
      "``I will repeat what the nuns taught me at St\n",
      "James a long time ago: We would all be a hell of a lot better off looking after our own souls rather than trying to evaluate somebody else's\n",
      "None of us have any business even having an opinion on it.'' Even conservative Republicans seemed ready to overlook the disclosure\n",
      "``We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated your vows with your wife,''' said Rep\n",
      "Lindsey Graham, R-S.C\n",
      "Like many, including Livingston, Graham distinguished Livingston's conduct from Clinton's by saying that the president had ``trampled'' on the legal system whereas Livingston's behavior was strictly private\n",
      "Despite Flynt's claims, many Republicans blamed the Clinton administration for smearing Livingston, although they offered no evidence\n",
      "``This isn't just happening on its own,'' said Rep\n",
      "Dana Rohrabacher, R- Calif\n",
      "\n",
      "The raw passions were such that the House Democrats did not to hesitate to bellow ``You resign! You resign!'' at Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called from the House floor for President Clinton to quit the White House in the face of certain impeachment\n",
      "Shockingly, stunningly, Livingston did just that\n",
      "He quit in one breathtaking utterance, as if flicking a trump card onto the heap of impeachment angst festering before his eyes in the debating chamber\n",
      "In his one and only strategem in leading his fellow House Republicans, Livingston's decision struck Congress like a verbal bomb\n",
      "Stunned Democrats saw their fury vaporized upon the instant\n",
      "They had to stand, almost staggering to their feet, to join the Republicans in a prolonged, emotional ovation for Livingston and his undeniable self-sacrifice\n",
      "As they stood, the Democrats sensed Livingston had most suddenly closed a trap on the president and his defenders\n",
      "For, with the impeachment issue set to move to the Senate, Livingston, whose own marital indiscretions were now before the public to his obvious misery, chose to show how the question of a political leader's resignation was very much in play in this tumult-tossed city\n",
      "``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow,'' Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond\n",
      "Livingston walked off the floor like the sheriff in some bullet-pocked political ``High Noon,'' discarding the leadership badge he had wrested from the earlier speaker-casualty, Newt Gingrich\n",
      "In the corridor just beyond, a doorman shouted to a police officer: ``Livingston just resigned!'' ``What? What?'' came the reply from the officer, who obviously thought the momentous announcement would be about Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation\n",
      "Just so, the Democrats, already deep into bone-raw exhaustion after their long fight to save the president, grasped for bearings\n",
      "``It is a surrender to a developing sexual McCarthyism!'' declared Rep\n",
      "Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading presidential defender trying to rally Democrats around the argument that Livingston should not resign any more than President Clinton should quit under fire\n",
      "But the Republicans were surging to the fore on the strength of Livingston's announcement, fighting tears as they rose to salute him as the ultimate political role model in the grueling impeachment process as it roared into the final minutes of debate\n",
      "``For some it is no longer good enough to make a mistake, to confirm that mistake and take the consequences of that mistake,'' said Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, his hands shaking, his eyes tearing as he addressed the House and sought to drive the example of Livingston all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue\n",
      "``He understood what this debate was all about _ honor, duty, integrity and the truth,'' said DeLay arguing that in one swift blow, Livingston had demonstrated himself to have been a far better speaker than Clinton has been a president\n",
      "With something of the political elan the president showed in initiating the Iraq attack as his own impeachment loomed, House Republicans, battered in public opinion polls, had found a rocket's red glare of their own\n",
      "``I have hurt you all deeply and beg your forgiveness,'' Livingston told the House, the nation and his family as he announced retreat\n",
      "Only moments before, Democrats openly hissed the man as Livingston firmly read his own judgment upon the president: ``Sir, you have done great damage to this nation over the past year.'' Presidential resignation was in order, he continued, and then came the shouts of ``You resign! You resign!'' And as Livingston closed the circle on his career, he stunned the place into a collective breath of disbelief and somehow almost threatened to reduce the dark historic issue before the House _ the impeachment of the president _ into a matter of anticlimax\n",
      "``They must not succeed,'' David Bonior, the Democratic whip said of the Republicans as he was given the task of refocusing the day on the misdeeds of the president, not the departure of the speaker\n",
      "``We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted from that,'' he declared\n",
      "``The only way we can stop this vicious cycle,'' Bonior cried out from the floor, ``is if we refuse to give into it, whether it is Bill Clinton or Bob Livingston.'' But the House was still reeling through the frenzied day as the fateful vote on the presidency approached and the notion of resignation licked about the capital city like a flame in a forest\n",

      "But at the White House, where calls for Clinton's resignation are derided as a Republican strategy, the president sent a spokesman into the driveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his resignation\n",
      "Livingston stood in the well of the House he has served for two decades and called on Clinton to resign his office rather than force a trial in the Senate, drawing boos from his colleagues and cat-calls that he should quit instead\n",
      "He then did just that\n",
      "``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow,'' Livingston announced to a shocked and silent chamber in an act that left the Republican Party in total chaos just hours before the vote to impeach Clinton\n",

      "They had threatened to withhold their votes for him in the election in January that would formally make him speaker\n",
      "He was also concerned about the pain caused to his family by further disclosures, some members said\n",

      "Livingston met privately with his closest advisers Friday as the impeachment debate unfolded\n",
      "Some of his colleagues believed he had made a mistake in disclosing Thursday night _ just as the House was moving into the divisive debate over impeachment _ that he had ``on occasion strayed from my marriage.'' He told Republican leaders late Thursday afternoon that Hustler magazine was going to expose his affairs early next year\n",
      "Some leaders urged him to keep quiet, but his wife, Bonnie, encouraged him to tell his colleagues immediately, despite the momentous vote that was nearing on the floor\n",

      "Something is going on repeatedly that has to be stopped, and that is a confusion between private acts of infidelity and public acts.'' To much applause, Hyde declared: ``Congress has no business intruding into private acts.'' Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made this same distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, saying that Clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused the legal system and his powers\n",
      "As Livingston said in his statement Thursday: ``These indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' Democrats hoped that Livingston's seemingly drastic action would wake up the House to how poisoned the atmosphere had become and might prompt Republicans to reconsider the impeachment of Clinton\n",

      "``It's a terrible capitulation to the negative political forces that are consuming our political system and our country,'' Gephardt said, adding that the events of the last few days showed ``life imitates farce.'' ``We need to stop destroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality,'' he said, urging his colleagues to ``step back from the abyss'' and reject resignation, impeachment and ``vicious self-righteousness.'' \n",

      "You, sir, may resign your post.'' Angry Democrats booed and shouted, ``You resign!'' Livingston continued, ``I can only challenge you in such fashion if I am willing to heed my own words.'' Apologizing again for extramarital affairs revealed two days ago, he said, ``I believe I had it in me to do a fine job\n",

      "The debate over the president's fate would go forward, Republicans later insisted, drawing distinctions between the speaker-elect's revelations and the sex-and-mendacity scandal that has put Clinton on the brink of impeachment\n",
      "The president is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions\n",
      "Democrats offered no immediate comment, but Republicans were braced to hear Livingston's admissions alluded to in the debate Friday by Democrats who have decried the investigation of the president as basically a partisan and unfair rummaging through his sex life\n",
      "Livingston, saying he had sought spiritual counseling and had received the forgiveness of his family, noted he had several times told reporters during his campaign to become speaker that ``I was running for speaker, not sainthood.'' He added, ``There was a reason for those words.'' ``During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his brief prepared statement\n",
      "But he attempted to draw a contrast with the allegations against the president, asserting: ``I want to assure everyone that these indiscretions were not with employees on my staff and I have never been asked to testify under oath about them.'' The disclosure of the speaker-elect's marital infidelities, disclosed in ``Rollcall,'' a Capitol Hill newspaper, sent a new jolt of uncertainty among lawmakers as they prepared for the momentous debate over the president's admitted misbehavior in office and whether he should be impeached and tried by the Senate\n",

      "In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.'' Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,'' in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic\n",
      "That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major players in power politics.'' Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages\n",
      "In ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into English, a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind, and the affliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale of social collapse\n",

      "``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style of fiction gives him a high standing ..\n",
      "he invokes tradition in a way that in the current state of things can be described as radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize)\n",

      "A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most prestigious prize for writers\n",
      "The prize focuses intense media attention on the Swedish capital and the clamor of journalists generally drowns out a question: Why does the world care so much about the literary choices of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country? Does the Nobel Prize really recognize the best? When asked that question, Swedish Academy permanent secretary Sture Allen smiled and said ``Look at the list of prizewinners!'' The answer obscures as much as it clarifies\n",
      "On one hand, the Nobel Prize has recognized world-renowned writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer and brought little-known wonders to light, such as Wislawa Szymborska\n",
      "But the prize arguably also has honored the mediocre, heaping attention on those who would have been more fairly served by obscurity\n",
      "Among them is the winner of the first prize in 1901, Sully Prudhomme\n",
      "That choice was denounced by Sweden's leading literary light, August Strindberg, and a group of Swedes sent a letter to Leo Tolstoy apologizing for the Academy's slight in not choosing him\n",
      "Arguments over the Academy's choices are inevitable, considering the instructions they were given\n",
      "Nobel's will says the prize should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.'' What, exactly, he meant by ``ideal** is unclear and the Academy's choices have reflected the confusion\n",
      "The Academy has chosen to interpret the word to apply to works ranging from the good-hearted charm of Szymborska's poetry to the crushing hopelessness of Samuel Beckett's writings\n",
      "When Nobel wrote the word ``ideal'' _ in Swedish ``idealisk** _ he superimposed the last couple of letters over previous one\n",
      "Allen was so curious to understand Nobel's thoughts that he engaged a forensic expert to try to find out what the earlier letters were\n",
      "The expert succeeded _ to a point\n",
      "He found that the first word Nobel wrote was ``idealirad,'' a word that doesn't exist\n",
      "Despite the inclarity around the edges, Allen said he is confident that the Academy's choices bolster Nobel's core idea that ``literature would be the basis for some kind of progress.'' About this year's choice, he won't say more than that: the Academy is bound to keep its deliberations secret\n",
      "But observers love to speculate on who might win, even who's on the shortlist for the prize, this year worth 7.6 million kronor (about dlrs 974,000)\n",

      "``It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese language,'' Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking through an interpreter\n",
      "Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and iconoclastic views, said he shared the honor with his country and he hoped winning the prize would make Portugal and its language ``more visible and audible.'' ``I'm personally very happy for myself\n",
      "I'm also happy for my country,'' he said at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany where he was engulfed by well-wishers offering roses\n",
      "Back home, President Jorge Sampaio said the award was a cause for ``great collective satisfaction.'' Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said the award was ``above all a prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language'' which is spoken by 180 million worldwide, mostly in Brazil, but also in Portugal's five former colonies in Africa\n",
      "Saramago's controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have frequently clashed with the establishment and the general public\n",
      "Even on the day he won the prize, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy's choice, describing Saramago as an ``old-school communist'' who had a ``substantially antireligious vision.'' Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara was so upset by one of Saramago's novels in 1992 that he withdrew his name from Portugal's nominees for the European Literature Prize\n",
      "At the time, Lara said Saramago's 1991 novel ``O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (The Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's Roman Catholic religious convictions and divided the country\n",
      "The book describes a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion\n",

      "A gaunt man with wisps of white hair, Saramago was born in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon\n",
      "From a poor family, he never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker\n",
      "His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis\n",
      "It sold badly but won enough recognition to propel him from the welder's shop to a literary magazine\n",
      "But for the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist\n",
      "He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled by a military uprising in 1974\n",
      "Since the 1980s, he has been one of Portugal's best-selling contemporary writers and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages\n",
      "He first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical fantasy ``Memorial do Convento,'' published in English in 1988 as ``Baltasar and Blimunda.'' It is set during the Catholic-inspired inquisition and explores the war between individuals and organized religion, picking up Saramago's recurring theme of the loner struggling against authority\n",
      "He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez because his prose is often rooted in recognizable settings but at the same time tinged with magical elements\n",
      "The Nobel citation praised his work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.'' Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views are always inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man\n",

In the 1989 ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' a Lisbon proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors, thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a stroke of his pen\n",
      "Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks\n",

      "The award committee said that ``this was the first discovery that a gas can act as a signal molecule in the organism.'' The discovery was startling because ``nitric oxide is totally different from any other known signal molecule and so unstable that it is converted to nitrate and nitrite within 10 seconds.''

Lundestad said the committee, which works in deep secrecy in its five or six meetings a year, tried to find a loophole in the rules, which are overseen by the Swedish Nobel Foundation\n",

      "A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers\n",
      "``I'm not the only one who deserved it'', said the first Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award\n",
      "``There have been other Portuguse authors, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels'' Speaking at a packed press coference in Madrid, Saramago joked about how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at Frankfurt airport as he waited for a flight home to Spain's Canary Islands\n",
      "The news left the 75-year-old writer no choice but to leave the airport and return to the city's book fair to meet the press and public\n",
      "``At that moment I was over the moon and returning to the book fair the only thing I was worried about was that the whole thing was an error,'' said Saramago\n",
      "Dismissing the Vatican paper's disapproval Thursday of his achievment, Saramago, a known atheist, quipped that he was aware that ``the Pope had been among the jury, I wouldn't have won the prize.'' ``The Vatican is easily upset'', said Saramago, ``I think that the Vatican should keep its mind on its prayers and leave people alone''\n",
      "Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago was reflected in the daily papers, with even the country's three daily sports papers ample space to the event\n",
      "The two leading dailies, Publico and Diario de Noticias, gave over their entire front pages to Saramago\n",
      "Lisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying ``Congratulations Jose Saramago'' which were hung up around the capital during the night\n",
      "Saramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon\n",
      "He never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker\n",
      "``Nothing in my life would have led one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize'', said Saramago\n",
      "``I wasn't born to win the Nobel\n",
      "I didn't have my own books until I was 18.'' His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or ``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis\n",
      "For the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the 41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist\n",
      "He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled by a military uprising in 1974\n",
      "Since the 1980s, his works have been translated into more than 20 languages\n",
      "Regarding the future, Saramago said the book he is currently working on will be called ``The Cavern'' and deals with a modern version of myth of Plato and the cave\n",
      "\n",
      "Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm\n",
      "A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glasses often give him a mien of severity, Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer _ and one of the first card-carrying Communists _ to become a Nobel Literature laureate\n",
      "He is also the fourth successive European to win the prize, after Italy's Dario Fo in 1997, Poland's Wislawa Szymborska in 1996 and Ireland's Seamus Heaney in 1995\n",
      "In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy praised Saramago ``who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality.'' Although Saramago discounts the influence of Latin American ``magical realism'' on his work, his novels often use the supernatural, allegorical, paradoxical and irrational as ways of addressing complex questions of faith and existence\n",
      "Many of his novels are set against a backdrop of political or historical events, but it is his unwavering concern for individual fate that gives his fiction its distinctive voice and independent character\n",
      "His best-known books, all published in the United States, are ``Baltasar and Blimunda,'' ``The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,'' ``The Stone Raft'' and ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon.'' His latest book available in English, ``Blindness,'' in which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind, was described as his ``symphonic new novel'' by Andrew Miller in The New York Times Book Review on Sunday\n",
      "``There is no cynicism and there are no conclusions, just a clear-eyed and compassionate acknowledgment of things as they are, a quality than can only honestly be termed as wisdom,'' Miller, himself a novelist, wrote\n",
      "``We should be grateful when it is handed to us in such generous measures.'' Saramago learned of his award Thursday at Frankfurt airport, where he was preparing to fly home via Madrid to Lanzarote in the Canary Islands after attending the Frankfurt Book Fair\n",
      "Earlier this week, he participated in a round-table of Portuguese writers on the topic, ``Why I am still a Communist.'' He immediately returned to the fair where he was received with cheers and bouquets of roses\n",
      "``I am personally very happy for myself,'' he said\n",
      "``I am also happy for my country.'' Later he told a news conference: ``The Portuguese language had to wait 100 years for this\n",
      "There have to be ways and means of protecting the language so that it does not become a museum, but is something that is alive\n",
      "The writer's role is to protect it and work with it.'' The award was also celebrated in Lisbon, where President Jorge Sampaio described it as ``recognition of Portuguese culture,'' while the local Communist leader, Carlos Carvalho, saw it as a credit to his own party\n",
      "``As a member of our party,'' he noted solemnly, ``Saramago makes a great contribution to our ideals and to the struggle for social change.'' The laureate's fiction, though, is never overtly political\n",
      "Saramago, whose body of work includes poetry, essays, plays and a journal as well as 10 novels, is unusual for having emerged as a major literary figure only at the age of 60\n",
      "His novels have since been translated into 30 languages, selling particularly well in Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Italy and Germany\n",
      "While he has not been well known in the United States, his novels have always been critically well received there\n",
      "For all his late blooming, though, Saramago long dreamed of becoming a writer\n",
      "Born into a family of rural laborers and raised in Lisbon, he was forced by poverty to leave school while a teen-ager and learn the trade of car mechanic\n",
      "Yet he managed to publish a small novel at the age of 25\n",
      "Later, he found work at a Lisbon publishing company, but the oppressive and censorial atmosphere of the Salazar dictatorship discouraged him from writing\n",
      "It was only after Portugal's April 1974 revolution that Saramago felt free to find his voice\n",
      "A member of the Portuguese Communist Party since 1969, he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left looked likely to seize power in Portugal\n",
      "But an anti-Communist backlash in November 1975 forced him out of the newspaper and he began translating French texts into Portuguese to make ends meet\n",
      "In the late 1970s, he also turned to novels, publishing three in succession in 1977, 1978 and 1980\n",
      "But it was in 1982, with ``Baltasar and Blimunda'' (``Memorial do Convento'' in Portuguese), that he achieved his international breakthrough\n",
      "``This is a rich, multifaceted and polysemous text that at the same time has a historical, a social and an individual perspective,'' the Swedish Academy noted Thursday\n",
      "``The insight and wealth of imagination to which it gives expression is characteristic of Saramago's work as a whole.'' Set in 18th-century Portugal during the Inquisition, the book tells of the baroque efforts of a war veteran, Baltasar, and a visionary, Blimunda, to escape to the heavens aboard a flying machine powered by human wills captured by the hypersensory Blimunda\n",
      "This fantastic story takes place against the very real background of the tortuous construction of the massive Mafra Convent by thousands of men held in the grip of the Inquisition\n",
      "When the novel was published in the United States in 1987, Irving Howe acclaimed it as ``brilliant'' in The New York Times Book Review\n",
      "``Mr\n",
      "Saramago is constantly present as a voice of European skepticism, a connoisseur of ironies,'' Howe wrote\n",
      "``I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility, caustic and shrewd.'' In his next novel, ``The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,'' which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who appears in it as a ghost, Saramago sets his story in the early years of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale following the romantic and sexual misadventures of a poet-physician\n",
      "Writing in The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang called it ``a rare, old-fashioned novel _ at once lyrical, symbolic and meditative.'' Saramago, whose sense of literary freedom is evident in his unconventional punctuation and conflicting use of tenses, sought a different form of freedom in ``The Stone Raft,'' where he imagines the confusion unleashed when the Iberian peninsula suddenly breaks free from the rest of Europe and begins drifting toward the New World and threatens to collide with the Azores\n",
      "To the delight of Britons, Gibraltar is left behind\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, the bitter satire, ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' proved controversial, with God shown as using the innocently human Jesus to create a religion that has spawned violence and intolerance\n",
      "When a Lisbon jury picked the book as Portugal's entry for a 1992 European literary prize, the country's conservative government vetoed the choice as blasphemous\n",
      "It was then that Saramago decided to leave his small, crowded apartment in Lisbon for the relative solitude of Lanzarote\n",
      "``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' published in the United States last year, is a whimsical tale set in motion by the decision of a humble proofreader at a publishing house to insert the word ``not'' into a key passage in a standard history of Portugal\n",
      "With this ``lunatic creative act,'' as Edmund White put it in The New York Times Book Review, he ``totally derails the national saga'' by affirming that the crusaders did not in fact help liberate 12th-century Lisbon from Moorish occupation\n",
      "White ended his July 1997 review with a prescient remark\n",
      "``Word has it that Saramago is overdue for a Nobel Prize,'' he noted\n",
      "``No candidate has a better claim to lasting recognition than this novelist.'' With the recent publication of ``Blindness'' in the United States, only Saramago's latest novel, ``Todos os Nomes,'' or ``All the Names'' still awaits translation into English\n",
      "In the tradition of Andre Gide and Julian Green, though, he has now embarked on his journals\n",
      "The fourth volume of these ``Cadernos de Lanzarote'' was just published in Lisbon\n",
      "Saramago will receive his Nobel Prize, worth the equivalent of $967,500 this year, at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec\n",
