      "The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings .\n",

      "Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here .\n",
      "He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December .\n",
      "Equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall '' , Mr. Schaefer said .\n",
