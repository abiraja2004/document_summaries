    function. The similarity function should take as input vector

    Implements the Grasshopper algorithm described in the following paper:
    Improving Diversity in Ranking Using Absorbing Random Walks:
    http://www.david-andrzejewski.com/publications/hlt-naacl_2007.pdf

    For a Matlab Implementation, see
        http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/grasshopper.m

    INPUTS:
        W: Matrix representation of an directed, weighed graph. Self-edges are
            allowed. Undirected graphs should be symmetric.
        r: A probability distribution over the sentences, with higher
            probability implying higher ranking.
        lamb: How much to weight the prior in comparison to the input graph
            weights.
        k: return the top k items as ranked by Grasshopper

    OUTPUT
        res: a list of (index, prob) of length k, where index corresponds to
        the index in the input graph, and prob is the probability assigned to
        it when selected.

    The algorithm is modified to take advantage of the fact that we only care
    about the expected number of states.
